0,This is the best compromise I can find,"First off, unlike the other review currently up right now I don't find myself making any typing errors that I can blame on the keyboard. I use this mostly for work and as such I type A LOT, pretty much all I do is write e-mails all day, chat with coworkers and do some small amount of programming. Programming of course can't have typos in it, otherwise things simply don't work. Likewise, my e-mails and instructions to other people are very technical. A typo could make all the difference in the world with what I am trying to convey. If this keyboard did not type 100% correctly for me then I would be sending it back. That simply is not the case. If you're wondering; I am connected via Bluetooth to my HP laptop that runs Windows 10. My laptop is line-of-sight from the keyboard; no physical obstructions between the two and they're maybe a grand total of three feet from each other. Anyway, so that covers probably the reliability in typing, what about the rest? Well personally this is the only keyboard I have seen that comes close to ticking all of my boxes, both in needs and wants: -Mechanical -Wireless -84-key -Aluminum deck -USB-C So why the compromise? Well, they aren't Cherry switches, but at this price you won't get those. Nevertheless, I don't have any complaints with these Gatereon switches myself. They're very smooth and feel great to type on. Can't say I have much experience with Reds at all though, but I like it. Secondly, while it's USB-C they stuck the connector on the side of the keyboard. Who does that? It's weird. Not that I plan on using it plugged in, if I need to recharge it then I'll just plug it in overnight, but still... Lastly, the wireless. It'd be nice if it had a dongle transceiver like Logitech products since they work oh so well but alas it uses Bluetooth. As I said before, I use this for work, I don't game but I do intend to do a very tiny bit once every never. Having said that I have seen enough times where this keyboard has had to catch up with my typing (and it's never missed a key I've pressed either), however infrequently that happens, even if it were just once an hour it'd be enough to frustrate a gamer. Then again, if you bought this for gaming, you are only fooling yourself if you think it, or any other wireless keyboard, would be good for that. Edit: one last thing worth mentioning for the BT wireless is that it is set, by default, to a power-saving mode. That is that for ten minutes of inactivity the keyboard goes to sleep, but maintains connection. It's never had an issue waking up. Related to that, whenever I start up it connects immediately and flawlessly, never had any issue with it connecting it just works (no power cycling or going to Settings, etc.) But! It IS USB-C! Even if it's in a weird position. It IS wireless, even if it plays catch up sometimes. It IS mechanical, even if it's not the gold standard of Cherry switches. Also, it IS 84-key: inbetween a 60% and a TKL if I had to describe it. It DOES have an aluminum deck as well, which feels nice to the touch, machined very well, and just gives it a nice, unique property. Also, it has lights, if you like RGB lights. I don't really care for that feature so I leave it off anyway. It's only been a few short days I have been typing on this but so far I love it. Not sure how long the battery will last but if I can remember to I will report what it lasted me of what is basically day in and day out of typing full time. tl;dr: I love this keyboard, it does everything I wanted out of a wireless, mechanical keyboard, but I would just fix a couple things here and there. Edit 10/07/19: I just now noticed that the LED on the side has started to blink which indicates it's battery level is no more than 15%. Also, I did lie and ended up turning on the backlit LEDs to see if I liked them and I do. Mine were fairly low consumption as I only kept them on the second lowest brightness setting, they were solid red, and not reactive to any sort of input just were lit at their set brightness constantly. I also had the normal power saving mode left on (ten minutes of inactivity and it sleeps, IIRC) and I never once switched off the keyboard. I did keep my laptop on the whole time, minus the first weekend where it was turned off, so nothing for the keyboard to connect to anyway. So from receiving it on 09/19/19 I used it every weekday for work where I am at my desk, typing the majority of the time (to be fair I also do a fair bit of research as well and do have phone calls, meetings, etc. where I am generally not typing). I would count today and the day I got it as half days, so it's about 13, eight hour days of steady usage before it got to 15% (the light may have been on longer, but I only noticed it now). Take it for what you will. I am going to see if it can last the next hour and a half before I stop working so I don't have to bother charging it. I mean, I got it because I didn't want to see cables. If I only have to charge it every couple of weeks after work then I don't mind one bit.","Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2019",,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61HnU16TqfL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7196gyWSRbL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71h2dFdk42L._SY88.jpg']",Verified Purchase,Dan,4.0 out of 5 stars

2,"OK for the price, but not ""the one""","This keyboard has a lot to offer in a competitive price. That said it's not quite the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. It's good enough, probably for many, but picking the right keyboard is an entirely personal thing. + It's a wireless mechanical keyboard in the 75% size that I did not have to assemble myself. + Mac first, compatible with everything else. + Color scheme is refined but not boring and some what ""Pro"". - Gaterons are cheap and you might feel it if you are used to something more expensive. - Battery life is a joke - even with backlight off you either have to deal with the keyboard hard ""sleeping"" every 10 minutes or dying every other day. It becomes wired very quickly... - Backlight is an absolute circus, I wish I could tone it down to an adult color that comes on as needed. Instead it's a 24/7 rave. - Certain key placements will drive you mad -- delete is sandwiched between ""screen shot selector"" and ""back light color"".

3,Simple... IT'S AMAZING!,"Well, there's not to much reviews about this keyboard, well... It's great, quality is really good, shinny, just amazing I really like it a lot. I saw on a review that is difficult to type with, yes maybe because you are switching from a Mac and the keyboard there is flat, and go to a mechanical old school keyboard... can take some time to get practice on it... When I turn it on and used it for first time was little complicated but, i used old keyboards before so, not a deal breaker anyway. I definitely recommend it to everybody, you have a lot of color customizations so... or if you want classic, white light or off. Sound of typing is really great, not too much noice but not the quiets. The only thing is I don't know why they put the usb c connector on the side they provide you with a usb c cable with a 90 degree angle BUT, it should be USB C to USB C not A to C. The aluminum color is not as clear as the pictures is almost black, it's dark grey, cool but... just to let you know.

4,"I was not expecting to fall in love with the keyboard, but I did!","Here's the story from the beginning. When I was researching keyboards, I ended up purchasing the Logitech mx keys (which I still have back in its original packaging). I used the mx keys for a day of work and absolutely loved it. It's wireless, comfortable key strokes, has a numpad (for data entry), and I can switch it seamlessly between my work laptop and my macbook. But, that same night, I ended up stumbling upon an advertisement for a mechanical keyboard (curse modern day advertising). Before buying the Logitech mx keys, the idea didn't strike me that I would possibly want a mechanical keyboard. I felt like my research was incomplete. I needed to look into this. I ended up researching a couple mechanical keyboards like Ducky, Leopold, and Razer. I never owned a mechanical keyboard before and wasn't sure what to look for. Then I found the Keychron K2 on Amazon, and it just really stuck out to me. It was wireless, supported multi device pairing, but did not have a numpad. After reading some reviews on tech sites and watching some Youtube videos on it, I found the opinions very mixed. The biggest complaint was about the height/thickness of the keyboard and how unergonomic it was. Alot of reviewers mentioned wrist pain while using the K2, and the need for a wrist rest when using it. So I order the K2, with the weird intent that I was probably going to return it. I was mentally prepared to experience wrist pain and be sorely disappointed by the lack of a numpad. Plus, I already was enamored with the Logitech mx keys I just bought. I genuinely didn't think I would be caught in a love triangle like this. My Keychron K2 came in today, from first glance it is a beautiful keyboard, minimal and I love the grey. The build quality is great, it has some weight to it and atleast feels expensive! I ended up using it for about 4 hours for work. And my goodness, what an absolute joy to work on. I got mine with the Gateron blue switches. From just a typist's perspective, the clickity clackity is incredibly stress relieving. I feel like my typing speed is faster. I did not think I would enjoy using this keyboard for work, but I absolutely LOVE IT. I didn't even think twice about the missing numpad, I think I'm already over it. Also, my wrists are not sore, and I don't have a wrist rest! I'm already looking for external numpads I can use just for data entry projects. Obviously, everyone is different. Before buying a mechanical keyboard I highly recommend researching the type of switch you would want to get it with. I love the gateron blue switches, but not everyone likes the clickity clack - my girlfriend especially hates it! If you want a keyboard that's more quiet, look into red or brown switches which are also very popular! Lastly, if you decide to buy the Keychron K2, keep the packaging in case your wrists start hurting from using it. For some folks this could be a deal breaker! As of right now, I'm still in a quandary. I typed this review with my K2, but I might end up returning it to stay with the Logitech mx keys. Or I might return the Logitech.... I don't know! Can I just keep both keyboards??? UPDATE 5/26/20: After a couple days of intense deliberation, I decided to keep.... the K2. Even though I'm in a job where I work with a lot of excel and data entry, the joy of typing on this keyboard just couldn't be matched on the Logitech MX keys. Plus, the minimal design of the TKL just looks amazing on my desk. If in the next couple days or weeks I find myself really missing a numeric keypad, I'll consider buying an external one. I should also mention that I still do not feel wrist strain from using this keyboard for a prolonged period. This Keychron K2 is truly a pleasant surprise for me. But to be honest, I probably could've just gone with the plastic white backlight version. I rarely use backlighting on keyboards in general, it was never a need for me. Besides that, because the keyboard is so thick, I can barely see the lights from my viewing angle when typing. I won't exchange the one I have though, I do like the aluminum body and the darker keycaps it came with. I'm already emotionally attached (This is my first mechanical keyboard). I do have one complaint about the K2 I received: The USB C port looks to be misaligned, its a bit crooked and I can see inside the keyboard. Going to email support if this is an issue, I might just be able to open the keyboard and pop it into place. Still charges normally but it does bother me a little.","Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2020",,,Verified Purchase,Christ,5.0 out of 5 stars

6,"Perfect in Theory, Flawed in Execution","I was so excited about this keyboard because it fit a very specific set of requirements that I had: Mac and PC compatibility, wireless connectivity (which alone narrows your choices down substantially with mechanical keyboards), and a compact footprint. Needless to say, after hours of research this seemed like the perfect solution. When it arrived, I was impressed by the build quality. While the metal only extends to the edges of the frame, it's very nice and substantial-feeling overall. Pairing it to my MacBook for work was a breeze and maintaining the media key functionality was great. The trouble started when I attempted to connect it to my PC. While pairing went fine, things started to fall apart when I tried using the keyboard. The first sign that something was amiss was when I attempted to log into Windows and none of my inputs registered. I ended up connecting it to my PC via the cable just so it would recognize my keystrokes. I opened WordPad and did some testing only to be met with an absolute mess. Dozens of duplicate entries (You wanted one ""f""? How about 52?) and missed entries. Mind you, I have a pretty small desk (42""x24"") so I didn't think the Bluetooth signal would be an issue when the keyboard was only 18"" from my PC, but sure enough, it seemed to make all the difference. Since Bluetooth is built into my motherboard, the only solution seemed to be keeping the keyboard as close as possible to the PC. If I kept it within around 1', performance improved to a satisfactory level - still an errant duplicate or missed keystroke here and there, but much better. I reached out to Keychron's Support team to see if there was anything else I should try. It took four days to get an initial response. I reset the keyboard as instructed but this yielded the same results. I also provided a video of the behavior as they requested. They responded two days later asking me if the reset fixed the issue (I already told them it hadn't) and asked me if the problem was that I couldn't connect the keyboard to devices (it wasn't). After another three days, their most recent reply was effectively “Yes, your Bluetooth range is apparently limited. Here's $15 off your order. Sorry."" This is where I gave up. If I'm going to have a wireless keyboard, I'd prefer that its functionality not be dictated by where I choose to place it on my small desk. I fully understand that my PC is probably part of the issue here, but having Bluetooth performance issues at a distance of 2' is quite poor, especially when I have a Bluetooth mouse that's working just fine in the same conditions. Maybe their continued use of Bluetooth 3.0 in their devices has something to do with it too, who knows. While I'm complaining, I'd also like to point out that the labelling of the switches (one for Mac/iOS or Windows/Android and another for Bluetooth, Off, and Cable) is terrible. Tiny, embossed letters on a black surface are virtually illegible in anything less than direct lighting. Granted, you'll quickly learn where each switch needs to be based on feel but if you're still learning, bring a flashlight. Oh how I wanted to love you, Keychron K2. I really did.","Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2020",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Lee,2.0 out of 5 stars
7,Solid little keyboard.,"I've got two of these keyboards, one with red and one with brown switches.  I use them wired, but I like the form factor and the feel.  They seem to be solidly built.  For reference, I also have, and use, a Ducky shine 6 w/ brown switches, a WASD Code with clear switches, an Anne Pro w/ red switches and a couple of Mionix keyboards with red switches, as well as an assortment of non-mechanical keyboards and a Logitech keyboard with Romer-G switches. I use the Keychron K2 whenever I don't need a number pad.  I like the smaller than TKL layout, while still having arrow and function keys.  The RGB lighting is nice.  I haven't felt the urge to replace the keycaps yet.

8,Great keyboard,"My experience with Keychron started a while ago when I purchased the K1 V3. Love that keyboard with its low profile. I want to take it to work and use it there. I was surprised when I saw a Keychron store on Amazon. I had been looking at the K2 for a while and decided to pull the trigger. Amazon had it in stock and I had it the next day. What can I say? Great build quality and am so happy that someone is making a quality mechanical keyboard for Mac users. I got the Aluminum, Gateron Blue model. Surprisingly, the blue switches are not that loud. I had another keyboard with Blue switches and it drove my wife crazy.  These are clicky but not overly loud. As I mentioned before - the aluminum model is very sturdy and looks like it'll last years. Only change I made to it was buying a set of YMDK 9009 DSA keycaps to spice it up a bit. I like the caps better than the stock ones.

9,Why is the keyboard so TALL?  May need to get a wrist rest pad to go along with this.,"I have genuine Cherry MX Blue and Red keyboards that I use for my use at the office.  I bought this keyboard mainly for the size so I can take it on the road with me.  I got to say the build quality is great.  It seems very well made and would handle all the tumbling in my backpack.  The blue switch keys aren't as clickity clackity as my Cherry MX Blue keyboard but it's okay.  The lights, bluetooth/wired capability, layout of the keys (I need home/end/pgup/pgdn keys for programming) are great!  But there's one thing I do not like about this keyboard... Why is the keyboard so ELEVATED?  It's due to the battery for the bluetooth function but it would be more ideal if they made the keyboard flatter but deeper for the battery.  I feel like I need a pad where I can rest my wrists to type comfortably on this. I will try to use this for a week to see if I can get used to the height of the keyboard but if you see the profile of the keyboard, it's pretty high.

10,"Fantastic keyboard, good first choice for mechanical newbies","This keyboard is great! It's the first mechanical keyboard I ever tried using, and now I don't think I can go back to a normal keyboard. I went with brown switched, and I like how they feel a lot. The responsiveness of the keys, the sound, and even just the way the keycaps feel, it's all just fantastic. Plus, this this is built like a tank! Mechanical switches aside, the layout of the keys is super sensible. The tenkeyless design means I don't have to reach as far for my mouse, which has helped with pain I've had when using my computer. It's compact but still has everything I need. Backlit keyboards are universally great, and being able to pick my colors and animations is pretty fun. And this keyboard also has other great features too. Being able to pair to 3 separate Bluetooth devices at once is super handy as I bounce back and forth between my laptop and desktop pretty often.. And since they are a MacBook and a Windows desktop, the dedicated modes on the keyboard are very welcome and work really, really well. Flip a switch and all your keys are mapped exactly how you'd expect. And support for a third device allows me to add my iPad to the mix, which the Mac mode works flawlessly on. I've been recommending this keyboard to anyone interested (and sometimes when they're not interested).

13,"Bad quality control, info on battery replacement and other stuff from taking it apart","I love this keyboard now, but it arrived with a few issues that were unacceptable. For context I own several mechanical keyboards and have built a few from scratch so this isn't my first rodeo. One of the switches (the one for the R key) consistently snagged if I pressed it just slightly off center to the right. The snag was incredibly bad and made typing on it just horrible. I had to open up the board and solder on another switch. I could have returned it but a lot of other reviews also mentioned issues that reek of quality control problems and I didn't want to risk trying another one. EDIT: the right arrow key snags too after I went through and tested it again. Luckily it seemed to be a clearance issue between the switch casing and the keycap stem, so I shaved down the offending edge on the keycap stem and that mostly mitigated the issue. I am fairly certain it's the switch casing itself as every key I tried snagged on the upper edge of the stem. Guess I'm replacing this one too, sigh. Another issues is that the keycaps weren't all the same height per row. My F5 key is noticeably (like a millimeter) taller than the rest of the row that it was on. Also the keycaps in the left column aren't the standard order (home pageup, pagedown, end) and there's no way to do a hardware remap if I want to change that. Also, not sure if this is intentional on this keycap profile, but my function row is also noticeably shorter than my row 2. This isn't an issue for me but it's worth mentioning. When I opened up the board there were a few bits and pieces of black plastic or metal shaving that were inside the case. Think they might need to replace the vacuum on their milling machine. One super big issue I have with the board is that Keychron doesn't sell replacement batteries or give any information at all . When I had the keyboard open I noticed a giant piece of isolation tape over the battery. Why? That doesn't seem necessary on a battery at all. I suspected that Keychron didn't want us to see what was under there, and sure enough information was printed on the battery under the tape (the tape took off most of the ink so it was really faded too, ugh). Back of the battery is glued into the case by the way. Here's what was printed on it, which luckily includes voltage, amperage, and wattage information: - HX 606090  3.7V  14.8Wh + NY  4000mAh  20HJL And the approximate dimensions of the battery for those that want to replace it: left to right width: 92.2mm (there's a little bit more left to right clearance) top to bottom height: 61.3mm (there's isn't much clearance for anything taller) deepness: 5.8mm (there's enough clearance for a battery maybe up to 9mm thick) I don't know if hiding the battery information is intentional (on the board itself, on amazon, and on Keychron's website), but the result is still pretty anti-consumer. A lot of other keyboard manufacturers do it too. At least the battery has a plug so you can disconnect it from the PCB easily. Keychron: please sell replacement batteries or give information about it on your website. I would much rather buy a battery direct from you than find a replacement elsewhere or buy a whole new keyboard if I still want to use the wireless in a few years. If you do this you'll be better than the majority of keyboard manufacturers. Okay, onto the actual board itself. If you don't get quality control issues I think it's a fantastic board. The backlighting options are phenomenal and the controls for it are pretty intuitive. The stabilizers on the board had plenty of lube on them out of the box. The switches probably could have used some more lubrication but that's a lot of work and I don't expect that on a keyboard this price. Gateron reds are still significantly more smooth than cherry reds though. Aluminum side plates are solid and very premium feeling. The screws holding the aluminum plates on seem to be some kind of self tapping torx head screw. The ones that hold the switchplate and pcb to the case are some kind of phillips head screw (threads are too wide to be m2 or m3 so I'm not sure what they are). The screws good quality though so they won't need to be replaced. The flip out feet seem fine. Not the most premium feeling but I doubt they'll break from regular usage. A lot of people don't like the recess for the usb-c port but I like it. If you have a cable that fits it prevents the cable from flexing too far in any direction. The mode switches next to the port are high quality and I like them. Wireless bluetooth latency is fine for most things. It is noticeable in games but I doubt most people would notice it in office use. Final thoughts: I love this thing, and it's a 75% keyboard that fits my needs. It sounds and feels amazing for the price too. However there's just some quality control issues that seem to be pretty commonly mentioned, and whole thing about the battery. Would I recommend this keyboard to people? Yeah, if you can accept that you might have to rma the first one. Wish there were more options for 75% keyboards in this price bracket but this keyboard is pretty okay.","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2020",Color: Gateron Red Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Cassie,2.0 out of 5 stars
14,pretty nice!,"After using a CM Storm Rapidfire (brown switches) for the past 4-years at work, I decided to buy the K2 for my home set up. I added o-rings to the keycaps to reduce the noise a bit. I'm not a mech. keyboard expert but just sharing my thoughts. Things I like: 1. RGB Lights!! I only had the white backlights on the rapidfire so this was a very very nice upgrade. They're fairly bright and I like the way the lights shine through the letters/symbols on the key caps. 2. The overall look of the keyboard is awesome. It's very compact and I'm enjoying the 75% layout (still getting used to it though) Some issues I'm running into: 1. Sticky space bar! - I think I saw a few reviews complaining about this and I'm disappointed to say that it's true. Maybe I got a bad unit, but the space bar definitely feels a bit sticky and has a hard time moving back up after the keycap is released. It's definitely not bad enough to ask for a new unit so I'm going to look into it and see what's causing the issue. 2. Ringing noise - There are few keys that create a ringing noise even after adding the o-rings. This might be an issue the keycaps? I plan on buying a  new set of PBT keycaps and am hoping this will solve the issue. Or maybe it's an issue with the switches themselves? idk... help me out here. 3. Gateron vs Cherry MX - Again, I will say that I am not a keyboard expert but I've used the same keyboard with cherry mx brown switches for the past 4 years daily so I've gotten pretty familiar with the feeling of them. With that said, the Gateron switches feel slightly different than the cherry mx switches. I will say that they don't feel as good as the Cherry MX and they're a little more tacky(?) - don't know if that's the right word. I'm OK with them but there's definitely a difference in level of quality and consistency between the two switches. tl;dr Overall, I'm pretty happy with the K2. It looks great but has some minor shortcomings that I'm sure can be fixed pretty easily.","Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2020",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,JK,4.0 out of 5 stars
15,Keychron is doing it right,"I have searched long for a keyboard that has almost no compromise on the features I need, without building a custom. As a software developer, I have grown used to the home and end keys, but as a gamer I wanted a keyboard smaller than a tenkeyless. I wanted dedicated F-keys, I preferred dedicated arrow keys, and RGB is something I crave more than I should. The Keychron K2 has it all, and then some. I wasn't seeking out a wireless keyboard, but having that option is amazing when I consider I would have paid the same or more for a keyboard without this feature. The lighting options are numerous and vivid, some of the best RGB I have seen, although sadly it doesn't have software to individually control each key at this time. I am impressed with Gateron switches. I typically prefer Cherry MX Clears, but for my gaming rig I wanted to try out linears so I have a red switch variant. I also chose the aluminum rails, which make the keyboard feel like an absolute tank. There is a lot to like with the Keychron K2, but there are a few key downsides. Firstly, the keycaps on mine are not very good quality. The page says they should be double-shot not, but I don't think mine came with double-shot as the legends are wearing on some keys. This is compounded by the difficulty in replacing the full keycap set, since many of the keys are uniquely shaped/sized for this form factor. The shift key, and the home, end, pgup, and pgdn keys are all abnormal sizes compared with a fullsize keyboard. My second gripe with this keyboard, which I assume extends to Keychron's full wireless lineup, is that it takes multiple seconds for the keyboard to start accepting key inputs after my login screen appears--even though I am using it as a wired keyboard with Bluetooth turned off. They really should take the time to correct this in a firmware patch. Last issue I have, and this could so easily be corrected, is that there isn't a single page on their site or in a manual with all the possible hotkeys to control the keyboard. A reddit page exists that has most, but even it is missing some. Why not have your firmware dev just make a list of all the hotkey combos so they can be in one place? This next item isn't an issue, but more of a request to Keychron: please do invest, as I think you already are, in software engineers to create software for your keyboards. They are amazing products and they deserve to have software controls and keymapping available. I spent most of this review talking about what I didn't like, and that is because a good keyboard shouldn't stick out. When I interact with this keyboard, it is an extension of my mind. I sometimes stutter as the layout isn't familiar, even after months, when aiming for home, end, or delete--but they keyboard itself is almost flawless in execution. I will be buying more Keychron keyboards in the future, and potentially leaving their competition on the shelves.","Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2021",Color: Gateron Red Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Nufangld,5.0 out of 5 stars
16,Fantastic keyboard. Such an upgrade from the Magic Keyboard,"I purchased the K2 with blue switches and aluminum body. This thing is amazing! The tactile feedback and the clickity clack of the blue switches is so soothing and satisfying when I type. The additional light show (RGB) is entertaining, albeit occasionally distracting. Luckily you can change the patterns and also opt to turn it off completely with the simple press of a button. The keyboard is able to switch seamlessly between Mac/OS and Windows with the flick of a side switch. It can also be used over bluetooth or with its included cable. Lastly, it comes with a keycap remover and some additional keys (like the alt cover for Windows), should you decide against having the orange escape button as pictured. If you are the current owner of an Apple Magic Keyboard or are only using your stock low profile laptop board, this will be a huge upgrade. My typing is faster, more accurate, and I cannot stress enough how satisfying the tactile feedback of a mechanical keyboard is. Once you use it for a day you'll never want to go back to a stock keyboard again.","Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2020",,,Verified Purchase,Jack Agopian,5.0 out of 5 stars
17,"Amazon is TERRIBLE, Keychron is great!","I'm struggling with ordering keychron k2 (gatreon brown). I placed an order for brown switches and got red switches. I understand, some mess up happened at the warehouse probably. Called Amazon representative, they were happy to do an exchange. So they placed an exchange order for brown. Today, the exchange order came in, and guess what. It's RED AGAIN!!! I called Amazon customer care again (little pissed) and they suggested to return and order again. I tried explaining the problem is with packaging. Because I see for both the keychron boxes clearing says C1 along with ""KEYCHRON K2 RGB METAL RED SWITCH"". But Amazon sticker on top says ""Brown switch"". Can someone from Amazon warehouse or concerned department please look into this, before i place my next order and receive RED SWITCHES AGAIN!

18,Not as good as I had hoped for,"My biggest problem with this keyboard is the auto sleep feature. I can understand the need and would be fine if it ""woke up"" smoothly and raring to go after its nap. But seems like everytime my keychron takes its powernap, I need to really coax and cajole it back to work. I have tried disabling auto sleep (which in itself isn't very intuitive and it's also not clear to me whether it's disabled or not). You are supposed to press a key combination for 4 seconds to disable the feature. I have tried and it doesn't seem to disable auto sleep. Or maybe I have tried a few times out of frustration of not getting any feedback from the keyboard and therefore I don't know if I disabled it or ended up reenabling it a second time. As a result, every time during a restart, it's a struggle and instead of being productive with my work, I'm here at Amazon venting my frustration. To get it to respond after it's sleep, I have to turn the bluetooth on and off a few times, try the bluetooth coupling key combination, try the cable mode, but I don't know what is the magical action that brings the elusive ""Keyboard connected"" message on the screen. This struggle has traumatized me so much that during some lengthy zoom calls, I randomly fiddle with my keyboard just to keep it alive. What I want from a good mechanical keyboard isn't some fancy backlighting ---- it's reliability. And that's exactly where this product fails, you don't want to be thinking hard about a peripheral and wondering when it might fail. It should be functional when needed. Super frustrated with this product.","Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2020",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,V J,2.0 out of 5 stars
19,"Mine won't connect via Bluetooth, but good with cable","Last update on 4/6/2021: I’ve gotten the newer version of the K2 that is hotswappable, because I wanted to try new switches and I could never get this one to work in Bluetooth mode. This one still works brilliantly in wired mode. I seem to have gotten a unit with some type of Bluetooth flaw that no amount of troubleshooting (firmware, factory resets, etc.) could fix, but for those who are looking to buy this older model of the K2, I want to say that when I tried draining the battery completely and then charging it fully, it took more than two days of me leaving the keyboard on with sleep mode disabled and the RGB light show running at full brightness nonstop. If you use the K2 wirelessly, you can probably expect to get a lot of use out of it before recharging. The typing experience is immeasurably more comfortable than the MacBook's butterfly keyboard. It feels substantial, it looks as cool as I hoped it would, and I appreciate that it's Mac-compatible out of the box. Getting the Gateron blue switches was the right choice for me because I'm not typing in a room with anyone else, but for anyone considering them, know that the sound of these blue switches is loud and proud. It sounds deeper but also louder when I use PBT keycaps instead of the ones that came with the board, which are attractive but prone to developing shiny spots from your fingers. Original review: After watching several video reviews and reading reviews online, I thought this was The One. Its combination of looks and build quality, as well as its lower price, convinced me to buy. Unfortunately, I was able to use the keyboard for only a few hours in Bluetooth mode. I turned it off for the night, thinking that was the right thing to do when I wouldn't be using it for about nine or ten hours. Then I woke up yesterday, turned it on, and have been unable to get my devices to see it ever since. After many hours of trying every recommended solution short of updating the firmware (which I'll have to do on a PC when I can get to one), I've given up on being able to use it in Bluetooth mode. I've ordered a converter to connect the cable to my MacBook Pro, but it won't arrive for at least another day, so I just have a nice-looking light display at the moment. For the few hours of use I got out of it in Bluetooth mode, I really enjoyed the typing experience. The keyboard feels solid and I love the way the keys click. It's got a pretty bunch of light shows. It was easy to pair with both the MacBook Pro and the iPhone XS Max the first time, but that's it.","Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2020",,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AWKH8ewML._SY88.jpg'],Verified Purchase,Cindy S.,4.0 out of 5 stars
20,Nice to use keyboard with a clean design.,"12/1/19-Initial impressions First off I picked up this keyboard with the black friday ""price drop"". I use the quotation marks because looking at the price history (using the honey extension) of this keyboard, it appears that the price was bumped up from ~$80 to $100 at the beginning of November and then dropped back down to $80 to give the appearance of a deal. Not a huge fan of this, but it does happen a lot on black friday so be aware. Overall, I am happy for the price that I paid for the keyboard. The build quality is solid! It's heavier than I expected (a good thing), probably due to the aluminum and battery. The keys are easy to switch out for windows or mac. There are plenty of lighting effects and the color can be selected for most of them which is fun. I have been using it to type up my thesis for a few hours already and am still getting used to it, but so far it seems comfortable and I haven't noticed any mistypes (at least not more than normal). I only have one complaint in terms of the quality and that is that my space bar has a small bump/rough spot in the finish of the space bar. I wouldn't mind all that much, but it is right where my thumb hits so it's noticeable.  I'd like to switch out the spacebar, but knowing me, I'll probably just live with it. I plan to update this review after I spend more time with the keyboard, I'll update on battery life and long term comfort and any issues that might pop up. 1/7/2020 Small update, keyboard battery finally died for the first time. I use it almost every day (writing a thesis RIP) and i do have the lights on most of the time. Keyboard still in great shape, fun to type on, not too loud.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2019",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,alex,4.0 out of 5 stars
21,I was happy with it . . . for a while,"I've had this keyboard for about 7 months. I like the feel of the keyswitches, the RBG backlighting works well, and it is compact.  Battery life is also quite good. For the first six months i had it, the bluetooth connectivity worked reliably. Now, however, it has become flaky. When the keyboard has been idle for a period, it goes into a sleep mode to preserve the battery; when you press a key, it wakes up, the RBG lights turn on again, and it reconnects over Bluetooth. That last part -- reconnecting over Bluetooth when it wakes up -- was the part that worked fine for the first six months. Now, it often will not reconnect.  (I press a key to wake it up, the RBG lighting turns on, and it appears that the keyboard is ready to go -- but keypresses simply do not register on the computer; my computer's Bluetooth controls confirm that it is not connected.)  I have tried a couple of solutions to this problem when it occurs: switching the keyboard from Bluetooth mode to Wired mode and then back again; and deleting the profile from my computer and repairing it.  Switching modes only works sometimes; deleting the profile and repairing always works but it is a royal pain.  As a result, I can only recommend this keyboard for use as a wired keyboard.","Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2020",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,uesjd,3.0 out of 5 stars
22,Great mechanical keyboard satisfies a demanding user,"Lots of travel, clacky, accurate. That's what I demand in a keyboard, and this delivers. I type extremely fast and need a keyboard that will keep up. This keyboard leaves nothing to be desired in performance. Ergonomically, there are some challenges. I recommend a wrist support depending on your seating position (vertical distance between your arms and the desk). I knew what I was buying, so nothing against the company or the keyboard itself. The markings on the keycaps are just big enough for me. I'd personally prefer slightly larger text, but it's by no means worthy of bumping the star rating down. The unit has some weight to it. It won't be sliding around all over your desk, which tends to happen with cheaper compact keyboards. I'd say this thing weighs around 2 lbs. Overall build quality is excellent. Lighting is pretty cool on this thing. The LED's can get pretty bright and are easily dimmed if desired. Lots of patterns will keep you mildly entertained throughout the day. The only extremely mild complaint I have with the backlighting is that depending on what pattern or color you use, the escape key text gets washed out. But considering it's the only red key on the board (unless you swap out the lighting key with the extra included) it's still abundantly clear where esc is. I use this keyboard on both my Mac and my PC (I just use the PC/Mac toggle switch between the two). I can't comment on battery life between recharges yet. Bluetooth connectivity is rock solid. I have not had the keyboard disconnect or lag. Keep in mind the keyboard will disconnect and there will be a single keystroke delay if you keep sleep mode enabled (on by default, 10 minute timeout).","Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2020",Color: Gateron Blue Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Christopher Kurowicki,5.0 out of 5 stars

Switching between devices is almost seamless. The light patterns are awesome and it is easy to shuffle through the settings to find one that you like. There is no software that goes with it which makes it easier, especially for Mac users. I saw a previous review that complained of frequent typos which actually prompted me to write this review. The typos are simply the fault of the operator.

24,Very impressed so far,"I've been using the same IBM model M keyboard since 2003. It was made in 1997 and it's been with me ever since through countless moves. It has yet to fail. When it comes to mechanical keyboards I'm quite the snob and purist. However, I've been wanting something smaller for work and play.  I researched mechanical keyboards and I didn't want to spend the time learning and building one. I ran into this Keychron keyboard through the reviews and it had good reviews. So I ordered it hoping it was going to be just ""alright."" My expectations for the past few hours have been blown away. The keyboard is the perfect size to fit all keys needed for work. I use function keys and special keys quite a lot, and it won't take long to get muscle memory on the new layout. I'm not a fan of RGB, but I do like that the caps lock key lights up red if I accidentally enable it. The keys have the perfect feel when typing. It has the nostalgic sound of keys clicking as you type. You can change this by purchasing little o rings separately. It also has a good weight to it probably due to the battery. The keyboard came in minimalist packaging, and even has extra keys for Windows and a pry tool. The instruction manual is informative, and the USB cable is normal length (almost 4 feet). I'm very happy and impressed so far.  I will report back on the durability of this keyboard if I find any failures.","Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2020",Color: Gateron Red Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Rick,5.0 out of 5 stars
25,"Coders/Programmers - Pay attention to the right shift key, and the placement of the left CMD key!","This keyboard is great. The build quality is solid and it looks way better than I thought - the outline of each letter on the keycap is really sharp. I used to use the Magic Keyboard before this. One thing that immediately became clear, though, is how much I relied on the right shift key being longer and the left CMD key is much further to the left than on the Magic Keyboard. Shortcuts/symbols that became harder to do: - CMD + T, which required a longer stretch - CMD + B - Creating the pipe character |, for ORs (||) and bash pipes It was jarring enough that it took me several days to get used to it. It's a bit uncomfortable, but looking at other keyboards, it does seem to be more standardized, with the Magic Keyboard being the exception rather than the rule!","Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2021",Color: Gateron Blue Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,aflashyrhetoric,5.0 out of 5 stars
26,Just hype... not really... thank goodness...,"I have been using the Cooler Master blue-switch Quick Fire Rapid mechanical keyboard for a while. I initially purchased it for my windows dedicated gaming PC, which I sold about three years ago. Overall, I've been happy with it, but it is the Windows version and over the last couple of years I've been using it on my 2020 MacBook Pro. Lately, I've been wanting the dedicated keys specific to MAC on a mechanical keyboard (e.g. brightness, volume, command key, option, etc.). Politically, I'm not an Apple fan and wish they would stick to what they do best. However, they have solid hardware, software, customer support, which I prefer for pursuing my second masters degree over the Windows platform. I've been using Apple for years... HomePods, iPhones, MacBooks, iPads and so forth. I opted to try the brown keys from my blues... great choice for quick touch typists (you aren't heavy-handed mashing keys...even so, this will fit the bill). With the blue switches, I have to be quite a bit more precise with my keypresses due to the mechanical feedback/actuation. I often miss key presses because I do not pressing the keys down far enough due to the resistance require for that extra click feedback... so I opted for the brown switches because I like the feedback of the blues, but wanted something that required less effort like the reds.. I'd take a blue switch over red anyway... just not my thing as I like the feedback with slight auditory feedback... blue are just way too loud and disruptive when others are in the surrounding area. I ended up getting the K2 with brown switches. Perfect match for typing papers... not too loud, but I get that satisfying clacking sound without having to get past that ""hard click."" Blues also make it a challenge to double press keys (two of the same letters back to back e.g. ""tt"" in the word ""letters). This makes my typing much more effortless while still getting that ever so slight and satisfying feedback (extremely subtle). I'm in love. Do I like the blue switches, oh ya, do I like the browns, I'm in heaven and probably should have opted for this switch-set long ago. I see myself using this keyboard for long nights typing 15-25 page papers as well as gaming as I did with my blue switches. I like the loud feedback/click of the blue, but I get that somewhat with browns and I don't have to work as hard or be as accurate with my typing since it doesn't require as much pressure with my key presses. My typing is much more on point when writing papers, extended emails, etc. Form factor wise, the K2 it is very compact. Awesome due to my restricted desktop space and I don't need the # keypad. When I read reviews, many mentioned the large and elevated front lip area... ughh, I understand what they are saying... ergonomically, no issues on my end with the elevated feet on the top side extended. It is nearly perfect... even without the top side being elevated. I'm pretty sure this company likely took this into consideration when designing the product, but it may not be for everyone (the thicker front frame area). Is the hype true? I'd say so. Look at all the positive feedback on Amazon. The company has been pretty successful. The keyboard was nearly $100 for me and I'm glad I decided to just spend the money to give it a try. The design is simplistic and looks great (professional environments and for gamers... wonderful compromise if that's what you call it). The RGB backlighting is fun and interesting, but not a necessity. I enjoy it overall. Would I recommend this keyboard to my peers and family? Without hesitation. I'd recommend it to my gamer friends as well as working professionals... and those who just want a keyboard that is comfortable. For those that just want something to plug and play... not for the money... e.g. my mother who will sit on Youtube and Facebook finger jamming away at keys. Summarily... get this keyboard if you want a solid typing and gaming experience from a quality product... for the average person finger-pricking at the keys... just go to Walmart and get a $5-10 keyboard. If your here looking at reviews... it is for a reason... you want a descent keyboard and are willing to spend the money... I'd say do it without hesitation. I purchased mine thinking I'd try it and simply send it back if it gave me any reasonable doubt... it is staying and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it again if need be... -------14OCT20------- Just wanted to emphasize after owning this keyboard for a brief period now that it is one of the best typing experiences I have ever had since my 20+ years of having to type on keyboards... I have 3 degrees, so I've done a lot of typing in regards to my life experience. I without a doubt would recommend this to family, friends for personal, school, and professional use without hesitation. The keyboard is a steal at around $80-100. The build quality and color scheme are outstanding as well and will fit most any environment... looks professional as well as fun with the addition of RGB that can be set to just white. This keyboard is great for gamers as well... just a no nonsense, compact, aesthetically pleasing keyboard that performs flawlessly. I know I mentioned a lot of this previously, but I can't emphasize enough how wonderful this keyboard has been since I constantly have to use it day in and day out.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2020",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Saint04,5.0 out of 5 stars
27,It's a good keyboard.,"Pros: Fair price Low noise (for a mechanical keyboard) Handles 3 BT devices well Good battery life Good Mac emulation and interoperability (including media control keys) Small size makes it easily portable, but it's also very physically stable Cons: No tactile confirmation of key-press (Gateron Brown v2) Limited to a preset selection of backlight settings The ""bumps"" on the F and J keys could be raised a bit more Occasional key-bounce (I think) No obvious way to check battery level I'm a programmer and touch typist. I got the K2 with Gateron Brown v2 keys to use with two Macbook Pros and my Android phone. Mission accomplished on all fronts. Switching among devices is simple and quick. I thought about getting the Blue keys for their better tactile feedback, but I don't want to raise a racket when I type (which is all day). I've been using the K2 since I received it three weeks ago and only recharged it a couple of days ago. I'm not sure I had to, but anything over a couple of weeks on a single charge is all I might possibly need. I've been using Macbook Pro's keyboard comfortably enough for many years, but the transition to the K2's Gateron Brown v2 keys only took a couple of days before I was mostly at ease with it. (I have an Apple Magic Bluetooth Trackpad beside the Keychron connected to my main laptop.) The K2's small footprint is perfect for my desk's keyboard drawer, even with the trackpad beside it, providing much better ergonomics than using the laptop's own keyboard. The only thing that still trips me up from time to time is that the K2's left-hand command key is slightly to the left of where my left thumb expects to find it, so I sometimes hit command-space with my thumb when I mean to use the command key for something else. The arrow keys' location is something else I have to pay attention to. I'll get used to it. Two major differences between Macbook's native keyboard layout and the K2's are the location of the ""fn"" key and the presence of the ""del"" key. The K2 has both a backspace and delete key, while the Macbook has only a ""delete"" key that performs a ""backspace"" function unless the fn key is pressed. K2's fn-backspace combo also performs a delete operation, but because the fn key is between the right command and control keys (rather than on the left side of the keyboard), I've been training myself to use the K2's ""del"" key instead. One thing I love, since I'm in vi most of the day, is having a full-sized, first-class escape key. (I love that thing, and if you're a heavy user of vi, you'll understand that.) I'm told Keychron is working on their own customization software for the K2. I'm really looking forward to that in the hope that it will give me considerably more control over the RBG LED backlight setup. I'm using the ""red throb"" setting now because I prefer an understated backlight, but what I'd like is for the red backlight to be constant rather than throbbing. I can find no such predefined setting. I work in a dimly lit environment (by choice), so on those occasions when I need to look at the keyboard to find a function or media control key, I do need a backlight to see the keys. I stand by the pros and cons I listed at the top of this review, but I would definitely recommend this keyboard to someone with needs similar to mine. I'm very demanding of my keyboard's performance, and this one has been a game-changer for me. I wish I'd been able to make this switch a long time ago. If the K2's key layout were more faithful to that of the Macbook Pro, I'd have given it 5 stars, even with the ""cons"" I've listed. (I might well be in a very small minority who care this much about that.) Oh. The K2's Android support was maybe a 2nd- or 3rd-tier reason I chose it, but the Android mode works great. I've only used it with my phone a few times for evaluation purposes, but it works very well. If I need to write anything significant on my phone, I'll definitely go grab this super-portable keyboard to do that. If it matters, my phone is a Pixel 2 running Android 11.

28,Awesome lighting and a very comfortable mac native keyboard,"The media could not be loaded. I've been looking for a mac minded mechanical keyboard for a while and just stumbled upon the Keychron brand. The lighting was probably the least important factor for me in choosing a mechanical keyboard but I was really blown away by all the crazy features built into this keyboard. I also didn't do my homework but now realize this is a bluetooth compatible board which is awesome as well. Admittedly I'm not a keyboard connoisseur and I haven't had this but an hour, so this is more of a first impressions review. Overall the typing experience feels petty similar to other mechanical keyboards I've used in the past with a few exceptions: They keytops have a sort of ""rubber"" feel to them which is very different from my PBT double shot Leopold keyboard. It almost feels like I have something sticky on my fingers which I imagine would take some getting used to. For example, if I'm sliding my fingers on from the ""E"" to the ""D"" there is some added resistance (this is probably bad typing form but it works for me). The case is indeed very high as some other reviewers have pointed out, and though I don't usually use a wrist pad it does feel more natural to have one with this keyboard. I'm using the ""red"" switch board and it feels pretty good. It's definitely not super quiet like my mx cherry silent Leopold but it's also not nearly as clicky as the blue or buckling springs I've used in the past. I think this really comes down to personal preference. This keyboard has a TON of features built in and the mac native designed is very much appreciate, which grants this a 5-star rating. Check out the video review attached to see the keyboard in action and the awesome lighting programs. For what it's worth I'm mostly typing ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"" over and over, or just mashing the keys to show off the light functions.","Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2020",Color: Gateron Red Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars
29,Great mechanical keyboard for Mac use!!!,"This is the perfect mechanical keyboard to use with MacOS.  I use it with my M1 Mac Mini and have had no problems.  I use it wired so it wakes the Mac faster, but from what i hear, the bluetooth functionality is really good too.  I can't say from experience.  I wish the included cable was at least a foot longer b/c it barely reaches my USB Hub.  You can use any USB-C to USB-A cable if you'd like, but i prefer to use the included braided cable provided with the keyboard.  The keyboard is a perfect weight.  Not too heavy but not light enough to slide around on your desk.  The clickiness is nice.  Not too loud and not too soft.  Probably mid range as far as mechs go. It has the Mac specific buttons on the Function Keys which i use all the time.  This is what made me go for this specific Keychron keyboard.  Some of the others don't have the mac specific keys. The RGB lights are nice but not necessary.  A nice gimmicky addition. The keys themselves are a nice two tone grey color that makes the keyboard sleek and minimalistic.  Nothing gaudy except the orange escape key which i quite like for it's quirky look.  The aluminum base makes the keyboard feel super solid and high quality.  No flex at all.  Some people say that the keyboard sits too high to be ergonomically  comfortable but i have no problems at all.  You can always purchase a wrist rest if needed. The packaging is top notch and lets you know that you purchased a high quality product.  The keyboard comes with an included plastic dust cover, but i don't use it.

Picked up the ""brown"" switch one, can't tell the difference from my real Cherry Brown keyboard. The full-sized layout means I don't have cramped fingers, the extra F keys and navigation keys are nice to have as well. The RGB lighting is nice to have, good diversity in patterns, though it's going to drain the battery much faster. I like that I can pair it with 3 devices and swap between them. Absolutely no problem with my MBA M1, iPad Pro and iPhone. Use fn-1, fn-2, and fn-3 to pair and swap between devices (this isn't mentioned on the instruction card). The media and function keys work fine on MacOS and iOS. Keycaps have a simple, legible font, with the lighting shining through. The red ESC key lights up a bit bright and can be swapped out with the included grey version. Key travel is smooth with the browns, a little clacky bottoming out, I'll probably put some silicone o-rings on mine. Overall, this is a good keyboard for the price paid, it's comfortable to use and works great with Apple devices, at a cost far less than other hard-wired mechanical keyboards I've purchased (bit of a keyboard junkie here). It will take up more space in a backpack and you should get a padded sleeve for it  for protection. I can definitely recommend keyboard if you're looking for something a bit more than the typical portable bluetooth keyboard.","Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2021",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,scottjl,4.0 out of 5 stars
31,😕 Beautiful but with unreliable bluetooth connection.,"Keychron K2 looks great, sounds amazing, and feels sturdy, but the Bluetooth connection... it's a complete mess. Before I was using a Magic Keyboard, and the connection was fast and reliable. My Keychron is all the time disconnected, you stop for reading a paragraph when you return to type, the keyboard is off. And when goes off, prepare yourself to waste solid 2-3 minutes fighting to make it work again, because mostly, it won't. Or even worst, you're typing and suddenly, you're disconnected 😡. I want to love this keyboard but is giving me headaches and productivity issues. I contacted Keychron because maybe my keyboard is faulty, but still no definitive answer.","Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2020",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QWH0b2WDL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81U5BKhGrZL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81U5BKhGrZL._SY88.jpg']",Verified Purchase,Joel Pesoa Irigoyen,2.0 out of 5 stars
32,"Fantastic keys and build quality, but very tall keys","The build quality is fantastic, the keys are impressively responsive and so pretty to look at. Great lighting modes with a very intuitive programing process. The usability is great after doing the firmware upgrade that allows you to lock the color/lights to a specific mode and set a special color for the cap lock feature. The case is solidly built and has no flex in the plastic. 5 stars except... well, the keys are super tall, with the closest ones an inch and a half above the desk and closer to 2 inches for the back row. After a week of using it as it, my wrist started to get tense and tiered because I tend to rest my wrists on my desk while typing which forces my hand to bend at a very unnatural angle for a prolonged amount of time. I guess this isn't a problem if you're a touch typist, but most people aren't unless you're a dedicated writer. Finally managed to work around the issue by getting 3/4th in high wrist pad.","Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2020",,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eq91wUCBL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jFfULqRcL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pa0wipwEL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71w3LPnxAuL._SY88.jpg']",Verified Purchase,Kevin,4.0 out of 5 stars
33,"Overall great, couple of glaring issues","I work in tech support and play PC games so even though this is my first mechanical keyboard I find myself using a wide variety of keyboards on a daily basis. This is my initial impression of the KeyChron K2 RGB with gateron brown switches. I am a PC user so i cant speak to its functionality on mac os. Pros: 1 1. The main reason I purchased this keyboard is that I needed a wired/wireless keyboard. I needed the freedom to connect to any device with my keyboard. Even in my own room i have a chromebit hooked up to my TV for streaming and such, my Desktop computer and my laptop. This does let me switch connections between all 3 with bluetooth without having to resync the keyboard. For gaming I needed the wired capabilities for quick response times and the overall trustworthiness of a wired connection. 2. I love the layout. I had an extremely hard time finding a keyboard with all the function keys, dedicated arrow keys, and lacked the number pad. It matches the vortex keyboard layout for $40 less. It makes it feel compact without loosing any functionality. 3. The clickety clack. Feels nice. Has an ASMR quality to it at night. When I brought it to work I felt a little self conscious about how loud it sounded even though the browns were supposed to be quiet. I asked my coworkers and they haven't noticed or are too polite to say anything. 4. Plug and play. No setup needed. Bluetooth was easy to connect as well. 5. RGB, plenty of options and it lets you cycle through specific solid colors for many of the patterns. Even though it its not fully programmable it does give plenty of options to play with. 6. Feels solid and high quality. 7. It has the largest battery at 4000mah. I do primarily use it in wired mode so I can't comment on how many hours this actually gives you. Cons: 1. For a $100 keyboard i would like some ability to customize the keys if i want to change layouts or program in macros. This keyboard does not support that by default. Keychron does not provide any software to edit the keyboard. Many cheaper wired RGB mechanical keyboards in the $40 range support this. I dont know why KeyChron didn't put feature this in. 2. Its tall. It stands at 1.5 inches and you will need a wrist pad to use this keyboard. At the same time most mechanical keyboards have a tall profile so this isn't directly attacking the KeyChron but it is something I wish I knew before purchasing it. You average non mechanical keyboard is probably only an inch tall with the feet up and that is at the back of it. 3. A lot keyboard lovers have complained about the keys registering a press before you actually hear the click. When I tested this myself it is true. It will send the command before you feel the actuation but its such a tiny portion of the key press that I don't know how anyone casually noticed this. It took me a few tries of careful key pressing before I was able to confirm this issue. This is probably a deal breaker for longtime mechanical keyboard users but the average person won't even notice this. 4. Not sure if this is an issue with all mechanical keyboards, just mine, or keychron, but the space bar doesn't have the same feel or sound as the rest of the keys. It was one of the first things i noticed when using it. TLDR: Tall profile, and no software support really hold this keyboard back for what it costs. I considered returning it because of Cons #1 and #2 but I cant find one with this same layout that is dual wired/wireless.","Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2019",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,AmazingSam,3.0 out of 5 stars
34,"Beautiful keyboard, however does not live up to basic expectations","Very rugged construction. I got the aluminum version. I have a need to switch between a mac and a pc, sitting on the same desk at home. This keyboard just can't cut it. Loses bluetooth connection constantly. This may be a battery-save feature, but I was never asked whether I wanted a battery-saver function/option  so I am uncertain of that. Great build quality, rather disappointing connection stability/reliability. If you just want a white-light backlight to see the keyboard in darker environments, this is a pain to achieve as there seems to be no simple way to do this- although it can be done. Built like a tank. Functions kind of like a Yugo. It will do the job if you babysit the thing. UPDATE The battery failed. I bought the keyboard in late May 2021 and here in August the entire keyboard has failed. I assume it is a battery problem. Disappointing for a premium, $100  keyboard. I tried to return it to Amazon but beware- the seller only offers thirty days of warranty. I'm wiser now, and will never again buy a product with a 30 day warranty. This warranty seems designed to satisfy basic requirements that the product is working when delivered but zippo beyond that. Is this for a reason? I will assume they know they can't offer more than thirty days, and only that because they are expected to offer SOME kind of warranty. Sellers who do this are bound to never retain repeat business, which I assume they accounted for with the high cost of the 'premium' product. Shame, I did like the keyboard although it never had good bluetooth. I never tried the USBC wireless aspect of connection so I can't comment on that. I'd suggest you steer clear of this keyboard. Your mileage may vary. The seller did deliver it promptly. That's all the good I can say about this experience.","Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2021",Color: Gateron Red Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars
35,Arguably the best bluetooth mech keyboard for MacOS,"I normally use Cooler Master keyboard with Cherry MX brown switches - for both Linux and MacOS. I got this keyboard for a Mac Mini TV setup and have been thoroughly impressed. I'd likely get another for any future MacOS desktop/TV setups. PROS The Gateron switches are new to me and feel pretty comparable to the Cherry ones. The aluminum build of the keyboard is really great and rivals the best Cooler Master and Razor builds that I've had in the past. The RGB features are nicely with plenty of presets and no need for trash software (onboard controls with fn). The bluetooth functionality works great! The keyboard connects quickly and reliably from sleep mode; it stays connected during use (no dropped keys or lag); it has a great range (I use it about 10 feet from where the computer is); and is easy to switch between 3 devices. The layout of the keyboard is excellent, i.e., matches any 10 keyless so there's no learning curve for me typing on it. I did hit the page up key by accident when reaching for delete in the beginning, but quickly learned not to do this. Finally, the MacOS layout and buttons are amazing; it's hard to find a MacOS mech keyboard that is compact. has good bluetooth, brown switches, and a good build quality. CONS I only have a few cons, and they are by no means deal breakers. The USB-C port is recessed meaning some chargers wont fit into the device to charge it. The labels for the switches on the side is incredibly small and difficult to read. These switches don't need to be used often, so it's not a huge deal, but nonetheless it could be improved. Some note the USB-C charger on the left side as a con, but for me it actually works perfectly; worth noting though. Lastly, the cable it comes with is not braided. Most keyboards at this price range come with a much sturdier cable than this one. I use it wirelessly, so it doesn't matter to me, but again worth noting.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2020",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Reviewer,4.0 out of 5 stars
36,Love this!,"First of all, it has both Mac and Win options, and they key caps to interchange, with the little tool. I, personally, bought it for my Mac, so it will stay as such. Works flawlessly with windows too, however, just a simple flip of a switch and its good to go. Has 3 memorized bluetooth options, so 3 different computers, which again, perfect. Pairing was quick and seamless, instructions are simple and to the point (I do suggest flipping through). Pros: KEYS: Nice and clicky. Not quite the traditional mechanical keys you would get from Corsair or Logitech, but kind of inbetween them and Razer. Either way, feels amazing. Nice stroke distance LIGHTS: Lighting is subtle, but well executed. If you just want some light illumination rather than *flashy*, this works well. It also has flashy, but yeah it also doesn't, if you want. Also, no software, just a light button. Its super quality, not like the cheap $20 BS ""gaemin' keeboard"" you find on here... HOME DEFENSE: The aluminum chassis is THICC and hefty. You could bludgeon someone with this thing. IDK what Keychron thinks people do with their keyboards, but thanks for not ruling that out. Seriously, it weighs like 3-4lbs, and is smaller than a normal keyboard. CONS: I guess if you DIDN'T want a thicc keyboard, that would suck, but its honestly lovely.","Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2020",,,Verified Purchase,jay,5.0 out of 5 stars
37,"Great Mac+Windows Support, uber compact, ok for gaming","I'm loving this keyboard. Check out the numerous positive reviews on YouTube, and also check the Keychron website to see if one of their other models fits your use case better (for me this is the best as it has the dedicated row of function keys, which is a must-have in my day-to-day). I use this keyboard to go between a Macbook Pro during work hours, and a Windows PC during off hours. Since I have multiple Windows boots, I like that it has multiple quick-access buttons for Bluetooth profiles. I chose the blue switches, which feel great and are very responsive for typing. I'm a big fan of the dedicated screenshot key which woks with both Mac and Windows using their respective screenshot approaches, as well as the attention to the /home/end/del key placements. The included braided cable could be a bit longer for those of us who keep their tower off to the side of their desks at floor level, but a desktop USB hub solves that problem. I usually use the cable when gaming to reduce latency and charge up. I chose the aluminum body, which adds a nice stabilizing weight to the whole keyboard. I'm not big on RGB lighting in my peripherals, but it has a few subtle profiles among the defaults, and it is pretty easy to disable entirely from a quick key combo.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2020",Color: Gateron Blue Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,John,5.0 out of 5 stars

39,"Good switches, wireless Mac native features. Ergonomics and power management could be better.","Positive: Picked this up with brown switches. Coming from a magic keyboard I needed something Mac native and wireless to easily switch between multiple machines. Tenkeyless has all the keys I need and looks slick on my desk. Tactility and feedback are great on the keys. Good as a first mechanical keyboard. The LEDs add some nice aesthetic for low light typing. Negative: Ergonomics not the best. I got a strange muscle cramp in my upper arm during the first week of use. This went away in the second week. Most likely this is due to my other keyboard being so low profile so needed some getting used to. I picked up a wrist rest and this is now a lot better. Battery life isn’t great, I get maybe a week off a charge where my magic keyboard lasted a month. The low battery indicator is also hidden off to the side so more often than not I end up with a dead keyboard in the middle of the work day. Overall, I’m keeping the keyboard as I can work around its shortcomings. It does what it needs to do quite well and there aren’t many other wireless mac native keyboards available.","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2020",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,msfncl,4.0 out of 5 stars

41,"Not the best compact mechanical, but EASILY the best value for your money (and it's wireless!)","Let's get the objective stuff out of the way first: the keyboard has really solid build quality on the surface. The metal back panel version feels like it's built like a tank, and the keycaps seem extremely high quality. The switches are definitely gateron reds, but the key stabilization is a little inconsistent (the backspace key in particular feels odd to press, and it keys are a little mushy compared to my corsair K62 wireless which has cherry reds). That being said, none of that really matters, this is EASILY the best keyboard if you're looking for the following things: 1: Compact 2: Wired/Wireless 3: Mechanical 4: USB-C 5: Backlit To the best of my knowledge, there are only a handful of other keyboards that hit all those boxes, and they're mostly knockoffs with nebulous build quality. Heck, there aren't too many keyboards that satisfy 3 of the 5 qualities. The Keychron feels like a premium product, for less than you'd think, and comes with some really neat accessories (Mac and windows key caps, an angled USB-C wire, and perhaps the most unique and functional keycap remover I've ever seen...good job guys!) So do yourself a favor, if you're looking for a keyboard that has all of the qualities listed above, stop looking, this is it. If you're looking for a wireless keyboard that has at least 2 of the other qualities listed above, the Keychron should certainly be in the running. While it's not the BEST compact mechanical keyboard, it's DEFINITELY the best value!","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2019",Color: Gateron Red Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Max Mileaf,4.0 out of 5 stars

And know this: I'm not peddling or running an ad/promotion for this company. But this keyboard is really, really good. I type literally all day long and I've had dozens of keyboards so I know. I picked brown switches because they are supposed to require a decent/medium amount of pressure to complete each keystroke. This keyboard comes with many* lighting modes. It also has a special lighting key just to change the mode. Then you can hold down the special symbol alt key and press the left arrow to select your color if you want a solid color. Of the solid colors, aside from your standard RGB base colors, there are even in-between colors like teal. Otherwise the keys light up in different ways using multiple colors cycling through them for each* individual key. The keystrokes make a rather satisfying clacking sound so you can feel ""cool"" like you're Keanu Reeves. The instructions are easy to read. The cord (if you choose to use it) is unobtrusive and neat. Even the box and packaging are of very high quality.

44,Great keyboard for work and play,"Switched to this board from a Keychron K4 (Version 1), so happy to see some things, unhappy to see others. I do data entry and decided to downsize as I use my external numberpad instead of the built in. Pros: Backlit FN legends Fancy RGB lights to play with Sturdy construction Type C connector Easy switch Win/Mac with corresponding keycaps (good for my dual boot Mac) Fold out feet have two positions Fast bluetooth response Finally have a caps lock indicator (caps lock key turns a solid color) Cons: Thin keycaps (the orange escape and backlight keys are unreadable with certain backlight colors, kinda funny) Backlight key takes up an entire space instead of being on FN layer but I guess that's Keychron's signature Mushy stabilizers (the stabs had some weird goop coming out when checking under the cap, overlubed?) USB connector is still on the left of the board, angled cable is decent quality however. The selector switches are really hard to move for some reason, maybe quality control issue? Still needs a palm rest to use comfortably for long periods of time The higher quality keycaps with the proper legends are no longer being made. Also that weird key between F12 and del is print screen, in case anyone else was as confused as me. Overall this board is a good buy.

46,The best wireless TKL on Amazon,"I took a ton of time to research which TKL board was the best under or around the 100 dollar range and this is the best option in my opinion. The build quality is super sturdy and the lighting is incredible and not overly flashy like other backlit RGB boards. The variations are nice and it is super nice to have a direct control for the brightness and modes without needing to use shortcuts. Overall the entire layout is incredibly well thought out and I never really find myself searching for the manual to figure out special combos for things. The base itself is a nice heavyweight aluminum and the keys (blue switches in my case) also feel super nice to type on and have that nice clicky feeling without being too annoying to others in the room. Key travel is good and responsive and the caps have not shown any signs of wear after a few weeks of daily usage. Battery life is pretty great and I only need to charge it about once a week, I use a static backlight on the lowest setting which is bright enough for any time of day. The only complaint would be that it would be nice to have some other kind of battery indicator other than just charged or close to being discharged. Connection quality has been very solid with not a single disconnect or missed key in the entire time I have been using it. I can't comment on range as I use it about a foot away from my computer but I'm sure others will who might for whatever reason use this on their lap or with a TV. Overall I would say if you are on the fence about which keyboard in this configuration and price range is the best, and like I did you have a hundred tabs open with all of the others that are on amazon with decent reviews, just spend a little extra and get this and you will be more than happy.","Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2021",Color: Gateron Blue Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,tomas gonzalez,5.0 out of 5 stars
47,A nice mechanical keyboard with pretty lights and good Bluetooth support,"I love this keyboard and use it daily for office work and software development. The brown mechanical keys have a nice tactile feel and are just loud enough to be heard, without being too loud. I could probably use it at the office if we weren't all working at home. I really like that it can be toggled between two Bluetooth devices AND a wired connection, so up to three computers can easily share this keyboard. I was able to use the keyboard's Bluetooth successfully on Mac, Windows and Linux Ubuntu computers. The additional toggle switch for PC/Mac mode is a nice touch. It seems to draw a lot of power sometimes when charging, to the point that my Mac once disabled the device for drawing too much power. By attaching with a powered USB hub this is no longer an issue. The keyboard's pretty lights (shiny!) have numerous modes. I'm always disappointed when it goes to sleep to save the battery since the lights go off, so I tend to keep the USB connection attached full-time.","Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2020",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,DC,5.0 out of 5 stars
48,Lot to like except for poor Bluetooth connectivity & key repeat,"I really like this keyboard a lot, until I start using it and then I cannot stand it. This is due to some mysterious 1-2 keypress delay that happens all the time. This happens even when the charger is plugged in. Lately I'm getting bizarre key repeats for zero reason. This messes up my work.  Otherwise, the brown-type keys have perfect balance of smoothness and clickittyness. The spacing of the keys is just right for my large hands, and the raised angle is good, though I have the near-perfect Grifiti foam wrist rest in place. The multiple backlight options are an affectation, but have an after-hours appeal. This may just get returned, sadly, due to poor key responsiveness.","Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2021",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Delinquent,2.0 out of 5 stars
49,A good keyboard overall with one big defect,"This is my second Keychron K2. I had the original version with the plastic frame and blue switches, but decided to get the aluminium frame with red switches (blue is too clicky for me). I have enjoyed the typing experience on both of mine and for the price they're hard to beat when considering the features. While I had no issues with my first K2, the current one has not been perfect. From the get-go, both the power switch and Mac/Windows switch were very difficult to move. At times they would slide perfectly, but most of the time I really had to dig into the switch to get it to move. Fast forward about 6 months, and the power switch stopped functioning entirely. I disassembled the keyboard to find the switch had in fact broken internally. While I could still move the switch outside, it was no longer attached to the circuitboard inside and thus did nothing. The circuitboard switch inside was very tiny and I can understand why it broke so soon. Unfortunately, this left the keyboard stuck on wired mode and I am currently unable to turn it off or switch to Bluetooth mode (which was a feature that first attracted me to this keyboard in the first place). Something changed in the switch design from V1 to V2, as my original K2's power switch moved perfectly with little resistance and very nice ""clicks"". Having searched around online, I see I'm not alone in this issue and I've read other reports of power switches no longer working. Overall, I am disappointed my still shiny and fairly new K2 has already lost a lot of functionality after only 6 months. I really enjoy typing on my K2, but given I now have a $100 wired-only keyboard, I will probably look to other brands for a replacement since I need the Bluetooth functionality. I am giving this 2 stars as it's a great keyboard when it works as intended.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2021",Color: Gateron Red Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Matthew Thornhill,2.0 out of 5 stars
50,"Quality keyboard, exactly what I needed","tldr; quality keyboard that satisfied my needs, especially for keyboard layout. Would recommend. I am a student who uses my laptop frequently for gaming, programming, etc. I was looking for a mechanical keyboard with several key conditions: 1. Wireless - I haven't had any issues with this keyboard's bluetooth, it connects quickly when I turn it on and hasn't had any hiccups. I purchased a pouch to carry the keyboard around with me. 2. Key layout - I cannot stress how rare it is for a compact keyboard to have this layout. There are some keys I cannot live without in certain positions, e.g. tilde in top left, delete, designated arrow keys (!), home/end, and a semi-large right shift key. I use both shifts when I type so I was deterred by all of the compact keyboards with just a regular single-sized key as the right shift button. This one I believe is 1.5 (not sure) and though it's definitely not the same full size as left shift, it is large enough. Also I do find myself using the function row quite frequently as well. The keyboard layout feels similar to my laptop layout, so there was an easy adjustment. 3. Brown switches - This is my first mechanical keyboard so I am not sure how the switches compare. However I've heard that brown switches are best for maintaining a balance between a tactile (there is a slight bump before the key goes down) and quiet (honestly still pretty loud but it sounds nice). 4. RGB - lights are cool, they give plenty of options for lighting patterns and switching colors. I don't think there is a software for custom mapping but given their options I didn't feel like it was lacking. The lights are not too bright but they can easily be seen in dim lighting and they shine through the keycap lettering so the letters change color as well. The build quality feels sturdy for me (aluminum frame). I heard mixed opinions about the keycaps but there other keycap options out there if anybody feels the need to replace them (I'm not sure how the stock ones compare). The only thing I had an issue with at first is the keyboard has a power-saving feature where it autosleeps, but then it seems like it goes through the entire reconnect process again when it wakes up, which causes a slight delay. Minor inconvenience, but the user manual includes the shortcut for disabling autosleep. The battery has been enough to last a couple days for me on each charge with full RGB running at all times even without the autosleep. I recommend charging overnight if you plan to use wirelessly.","Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2021",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,HW,5.0 out of 5 stars
51,Better than expected,"The best keyboard I ever used was on an old Data General (green screen) terminal.  This is not quite up to that level but for the money it's pretty close.  I like the RGB lighting more than I thought I would and keeping yet another thing charged up has not been an issue.  I like the clickety clack and make fewer typing mistakes with this.  Getting used to it was never an issue (although I still hunt for the page up/down).  I have to close my eyes and concentrate to notice the 'bump' in the brown key switches.  I think the wealth of choices is great but I'm not convinced that it would make much difference for me.  Battery life is good, bluetooth range is good and its not a big deal but it could wake up a bit faster.  I use it on my lap sitting in my recliner and size and weight are fine.  I've used in with Linux and Windows and its worked perfectly.  Wish I'd bought one sooner.","Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2021",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Dan,5.0 out of 5 stars
52,Best Mac mechanical keyboard.,"As a Mac user, there were no good options for mechanical keyboards unless you got a windows layout that works but not everything works as it should. When I found this I was thrilled that it not only had a Mac layout but it was also wireless. This also comes with windows keys and a tool to swap out keys if you want to use this on windows. The RGB is pretty good, its all controlled on the keyboard no external controller which can be a good and a bad thing. The LEDs get pretty bright and the colors all look really good. This is a great keyboard but its not perfect. The height of the board is very tall and I would recommend buying a wrist rest with this keyboard. The wireless is Bluetooth only which is fine for normal tasks but not gaming (I'm on a Mac so I'm not gaming much anyway) but my issue with the wireless portion is the keyboard will turn off after 5 min of not using it and takes up to 10 seconds sometimes to reconnect. The reconnecting is not normally an issue but can get annoying after a while, combine that with a battery of under 1 week with LEDs on and I just leave it plugged in permanently. But my gripe with the wireless doesn't change my mind that this is the only option for Mac users to consider. 8.5/10 would recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2020",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Jack McKain,4.0 out of 5 stars
53,A shame to see a good keyboard eroding after only 6 months,"I like this keyboard due to it's feel and features, however, after using it for only six months I already have erosion issues on one of the keys (the left shift key). All of the other keys are fine, but my left shift key is wearing away. Considering how well the keyboard seems to be constructed, and also for how good it feels to use, this is a major disappointment. To make a comparison, I've used a CM Storm Quickfire keyboard for years and have zero blemishes or erosion issues; even after thousands of hours of use, the condition is still perfect. If not for this defect, I would give this product a five star review, but I can't help but feel let down with this key deterioration considering how short of a duration it took for this problem to occur. I've even looked into ordering the K2 keycap set from their website, however, I have yet to see it in stock and would also hate to spend the additional $20 plus shipping cost just to replace a single key if it were in stock. I know it's a small detail, but similar to one cracked egg in a dozen, it tarnishes the entire product.","Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2021",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91pvbBF5NrL._SY88.jpg'],Verified Purchase,doomguy,3.0 out of 5 stars

55,"It's This One, You Want This One","I realized I wanted a mechanical keyboard and fell into the hole of options that is the r/mechanicalkeyboard and youtube reviews world and ultimately decided on this one.

I'm sure there are significantly nicer keyboards, maybe even some that trade out other features here and there for less money etc, but I chose this and it's perfect, if you're stressed about which one is ""just right"" and Keychrons seemed ""Too good to be true"" and the reviews about wrist strain make it sound like maybe you need to hunt for something else: No, buy this it's perfect, if you want a mechanical keyboard that does just about everything perfectly, it's this, get it.

56,Nice typing feeling,"I was pretty clueless when it came to mechanical keyboards. Had bought some 30 dollar pseudo mechanical gaming keyboard, terrible . Enter keychron k2 rgb brown switches. Picked up the white back light only, but I figured I wanted to add a little more color to my desk. Ordered the rgb and aluminum frame, wow, feels like this is going to last for a while. I do a lot of typing on my medical research job, and this baby is a pleasure to use. Some have mentioned a wrist pad should be used with the kbd because of its thickness but I haven't had any issues typing. I don't use the rgb effects because it's distracting, but it is looks very cool. The keyboard layout takes a little to get used to, but I don't use the whole layout. One thing I notice with my Mac mini M1 is the bluetooth connection, takes a few long seconds to connect when you start the computer. A couple of times it seem to not want to connect at all, I had to use the usb cable to login. But I tried it again and now it connects without any problems. Hmmm...It might have to do with drivers and the MacOS. What could use improvement: I wish I didn't have to use the backlight to see the keycaps, but that is a personal choice. Being a Mac user I think it is very thoughtful keychron takes into account that not everyone is a Windows user, my keyboard was ready to go the minute I got it. All I can say is that I look forward to using my keyboard, very few typing mistakes and I like the sound, brings back memories from back in the day when keyboards were solid and meant for work.","Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2021",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Marco,5.0 out of 5 stars

Keychron has a great reputation and this keyboard looks pretty slick. Avoid this particular LAYOUT. Visually the keys are well distinguished, the key caps are nice, and the RGB effects are neat, but when you actually start typing, you realize there is ZERO contextual information about where your fingers are on the keyboard... just a jumbled mess of keys. Splitting out the page navigation keys and adding some space between number and function keys takes a little more space, but it makes a huge difference.","Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2021",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,M.

It was built very well and typed great, except I got the linear switches and they felt mushy and I didn't get any feedback at all along with the mushy feel. Coming from very tactile switches, I decided to try the K1 with the blue switches. This keyboard is high enough to warrant a wrist rest unless you type with your arms hovering above the table. The space bar felt weird, like it was high and in the way. But, with your wrists at a proper height, it types just fine. As a gaming keyboard, I could see it being fine. I don't think it is a typists keyboard unless you like meshy keyboards. It is still a beautiful keyboard, well built, and great functionality.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2020",Color: Gateron Red Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Josh Frechem,4.0 out of 5 stars
59,"Solid Mac-first keyboard, with only a few caveats...","Since I needed new peripherals to go along with my new M1 Mac mini last November, after years of typing on flat MacBooks, I decided to finally treat myself to my first mechanical keyboard since the original IBM PC was offered with one.  After a long online dive, when I surfaced I had decided on the 75% Keychron Wireless Backlit RGB with Brown switches and Aluminum Frame. For me, these Browns by Gateron are an acceptable compromise between mechanical feel and reasonable noise, just as long as you are okay with the lack any actual mechanical ""break"" when actuating. I prefer not waking up the house late at night!  That being said, I do sometimes still miss a clearly felt mechanical actuation feel, but this works for me, and is still legions ahead of any membrane keyboard, or Apple's own.  I The keyboard is rather tall, but not exceptionally so.  I use it with the rear feet extended for a more sloped typing angle, which helps.  I ordered the matching Keychron Wooden Palm Rest in anticipation of this and it makes a big difference when I do serious typing.  I also prefer the feel of the finished wood on my palms over spongy fabric covered palmrests, or the bare glass top of my desk. When just casually surfing the web or doing other non-typing-intensive tasks, I put away the palmrest since it just tends to get in the way if I have to move the keyboard around and have desk clutter. Bluetooth is rock-solid, with never a glitch or delay, ever.  In fact the connection is far more reliable than with Apple's Magic Trackpad 2 that I bought at the same time.  If I recall, I think I had to use a wired connection just once, to be able to boot up my brand new M1 Mac mini.  This is a condition specific to only the M1 versions when using a non-Apple keyboard on a new machine. The RGB color options and patterns, though entertaining as heck at first, end up becoming more of a distraction after a while.  I ended up using one preferred color pretty much all the time. Keyboard circus lights can be distracting! A note on the colors, specifically blue.  Normally a color I might choose, this blue is not very bright, even when turned all the way up in the dark.  I always end up using the brightest setting for all the colors, all the time, to get to a decent brightness level.  Except for blue.  I find it far too subtle.  in my photos I use cyan/teal, which I like very much. Battery life with the RGB lighting activated is an issue, but it's addressed in the descriptions when you buy it.  Expect to get a full day's use out of it, then plug it in overnight so you're ready to go in the morning.  With the illumination turned off, it's much longer, maybe a few days. After nearly a year of use, I can say I am still satisfied with my purchase.  I wish the lighting was a tad brighter, and the rubber on one of the folding feet has disappeared (a much bigger problem on the Keychron Palm Rest on which ALL of the pads slid right off it's base - a BIG problem since it'll wobble without!), but not enough suffer any buyers remorse.  The keycaps still look good with crisp lettering, and they haven't acquired significant shine from use yet.  Battery life is as purchased.  it still looks and types great.  Whether or not you consider it's reasonable cost vs. comparably featured keyboards from some others, it's a worthy purchase. Except for that one rubber foot-pad... When one falls off, you know more will eventually follow.  Especially when you consider how awful they were on my Palmrest.  I tried everything to get them to stick - unacceptable that they all fell off within a few weeks of purchase. Keychron, you make some good gear that I'm comfortable recommending to others.  I want mine made right again; how does one get replacement feet, please?","Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2021",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,"['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719BaJHFJxL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sLQmtAv0L._SY88.jpg']",Verified Purchase,Peter Fablé,5.0 out of 5 stars

67,Nice keyboard despite layout differences with Apple keyboard,"The is my first mechanical keyboard. I switched from an Apple keyboard. I chose the K2 because it clearly supported macOS. I read enough reviews talking about the height of the K2 that I went ahead and purchased a wrist pad at the same time. This was a good call. The keys are fun to type on. I like the size of the keyboard. Bluetooth connection works fine. Mac compatibility is great. It does everything it says it would do, and I am happy with the purchase. However, there are two issues. 1) The layout of the spacebar and keys to the left of the spacebar (command, option, and control) is significantly different than the Apple keyboard. My left thumb has to travel up to half inch more to reach the command key. Pressing command+T to open a new browser tab is a lot more difficult on the K2 than on the Apple keyboard. A half inch might not sound like a lot, but I feel it every time I hit this key combination. Any key combination involving the left command key is worse. The fn key is on the other side of the spacebar. It's not hard to hit, but you'll have to get used to the swap or remap the keys. 2) Since the keycaps are dark, you're forced to use the backlighting in dark rooms. My Apple keyboard has white caps with dark symbols, so I can identify the keys even in low light. The symbols on the Apply keyboard are black though, not transparent like the K2, so I'm not sure if white caps with transparent symbols would work as well in low light, but I think it would.","Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2020",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Gruenwald,4.0 out of 5 stars

In the box they give you a key puller, a quality braided usb type C cable and a cover for the keyboard when not in use.

79,Extremely satisfied with this keyboard,"Full disclosure: the first keyboard I received was defective, but the Amazon return/replace procedure is incredibly simple and helpful—I had a replacement delivered to my door in less than 24 hours. Second disclosure: this is my first entry into the world of mechanical keyboards, so I am not able to compare and contrast well between other models and other features. I can simply describe my satisfaction with this keyboard. I am incredibly happy with this keyboard: I didn't know I was missing this. The keyboard itself is heavier than I thought it would be—though I think that I actually really appreciate this since it makes the unit very sturdy. One of the negative reviews I have seen has to do with the height of the board: I tend to type with floating wrists, so it doesn't bother me at all, but I can imagine that someone who rests their wrists while they work might be uncomfortable and might require some sort of additional rest. The battery life seems to last very long (I charge it infrequently, and it has yet to show a low battery indication). I like the various RGB light settings, though I usually keep it on a static white setting without effect. I opted for the 'blue' switches, which are in fact quite noisy, but I love them. The switches are responsive but also firm: you always know when you have activated the key press and, in my case, I can notice my 'errors' based on whether or not the click was felt. One of the reviewers brought up typing accuracy: this keyboard in no way interferes with any accuracy—I suspect that the reviewer simply does not know how to type properly and is utterly reliant on spell check. It is true that this is a very different feel from, for example, a standard Apple magic keyboard or MacBook Air etc.; but for anyone who grew up typing on early word processors and 90s desktop computers, this keyboard might actually activate a sort of nostalgia. Again, the blue switches are very noisy: probably not recommended for a shared workspace. I am now interested to learn more about the differences between linear, tactile, and clicky switches, however for now am very satisfied with my clicky gateron blues. The price point (I did get these on a sale) seemed right to me. Overall, then, this seems to be a very good introduction to a wireless mechanical keyboard. Happy clicking.","Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2021",Color: Gateron Blue Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,B Garcia,5.0 out of 5 stars
80,Solid mechanical keyboard replacement for Apple Magic Keyboard,"The Keychron K2 provides a solid bluetooth/wireless keyboard alternative to the Apple Magic Keyboard, particularly if Apple's Magic Keyboard doesn't provide enough key travel and as a result recognizes key pressure too readily.  The Keychron K2 keycaps are spaced more widely apart allowing for less typing errors created from accidentally pressing 2 adjacent keys at once.  In addition, the Keychron K2 provides back lighting (albeit in a myriad of 15+ lighting options all of which I will probably never take advantage). Having stated that, because the Keychron K2 is a 3rd party accessory, it is not as conveniently integrated with macOS as is a native Apple keyboard: 1. The Keychron K2 will not allow one to login to macOS wirelessly over bluetooth upon powering on or rebooting your Mac if you have File Vault disk encryption enabled.  This is not the fault of Keychron as currently Apple does not load 3rd party keyboard drivers prior to login in order to maintain the security of the encrypted Mac.  (While Keychron developers are open to resolving this issue, I'm not sure how much if anything they can do without Apple's assistance.). The K2 can be used to login if the included USB-C cable is used to connect the keyboard to the Mac. 2. While the K2 for Mac is designed for Mac compatibility and includes the Command, Mission Control and Search keys, etc. it does not include an Eject key.  So if one is accustomed to using the Control+Option+Eject keyboard combination to Restart your Mac, for example, then a 3rd party app, Karabiner, is required to program a keyboard shortcut to emulate the Eject key (i.e. Control+fn+escape). In addition, the Keychron K2 has a taller profile than the Apple Magic Keyboard so for true typists a wrist rest is probably necessary.  Finally, while Keychron states the sound level for the Gateron Brown Switch based keyboard is Gentle, as might be expected it is noticeably louder than the Apple Magic Keyboard.","Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2021",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,ichabodvic,4.0 out of 5 stars
81,Hands down the best keyboard ever made!!!!!,"I am not a gamer or a mechanical keyboard enthusiast by any means. I had only heard about/seen Mechanical keyboards while casually scrolling through Reddit. Because of Corona, I am working from home a lot more often and began to use my home office a lot more often and after extended use, the cheap Logitech keyboard I had purchased for my desktop began to annoy my fingers and hands and began to feel like a chore to type on. In addition, I had a multi-device setup for my home office with multiple keyboards that became annoying to switch between and took up an immense amount of desk space So I did some research and found out that Mechanical keyboards were popular among people who aren't gamers because they felt more comfortable to type on and some also claimed that the tactile response improved their typing accuracy. I began searching for a compact bluetooth mechanical keyboard that could connect to multiple devices and I stumbled on the Keychron K2.  I immediately purchased it and it is one of the best tech purchases I've ever made and would say it is easily the best keyboard I have ever used. My experience with mechanical keyboards is limited but the K2 feels amazing to type on and I didn't think I would, but I have seen my accuracy increase, which is important as a programmer. Switching between bluetooth connections is super simple just press the Fn key and either 1, 2, or 3. I liked the keyboard so much I purchased another one ! To take to the office when everything re-opens, because I also have a multi-device setup there. My only negative about the keyboard is that there is no home button for the iPad, I tried everything and referenced the k2 manual, but the Home key on the keyboard does not take you back to the homescreen on iPad even when the keyboard Operating system switch is flipped to iOS/Mac.  Instead I use option + tab to get back to the homescreen. Its a minor complaint, but the keyboard is so fantastic, I don't think it should sway you from purchasing it. 5/5 - Typed on the K2","Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2020",Color: Gateron Red Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Rajpaul Singh,5.0 out of 5 stars
82,YES!  Totally worth it.,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. First off, What an Amazing keyboard. The tactile feedback of the Gateron blue switches is ASMR bliss. Since I began to work from home I needed a wireless keyboard that could switch between my PC desktop and work Macbook. This keyboard does it all. it can connect with up to 3 devices at the same time and switch between them at a moment's notice. There is a dedicated slider button on the left side of the board that lets you switch between Bluetooth and cabled mode. Right next to that button is the OS slider that lets you switch between Apple and PC layouts. I Purchased the aluminum frame version with RGB and man, does it feel nice. The keyboard has a really nice weighty feel to it. Overall at almost $100 its a pricey keyboard but its totally worth the money. The attention to detail in this keyboard is Amazing. TLDR; Pros: -Great high quality feel (aluminum version) -Dedicated RGB light for the capLocks button -PC and Mac OS compatible -Great RGB effects Cons: - No software to config board - A lil chunky compared to other boards - Cable connection if on the left side not the top","Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2020",Color: Gateron Blue Switch v2,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61b7JsCJOVL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hocdAZTNL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61x2P9s33SL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VWVpTfIzL._SY88.jpg']",Verified Purchase,Edward,5.0 out of 5 stars

Keyboard is light, has a solid frame, and I use it for programming automation tasks in my IT security role. For the price, it kicks butt. But I think next time I'll shelk out the extra hundred for a drop ctrl. I can't complain about anything else - I had to be really nitpick-y to even come up with some cons.

84,"Good at first, but not a keeper.","I've used this keyboard as my main keyboard for 8 months. After 8 months it worked beautifully and then decided to crap out. First the On/Off/Cable toggle totally wore out and whatever was attached inside totally dislodged! I reached out to support and they offered my a free toggle and to solder it on myself. And not only that, I use 3 laptops for works for testing purposed and have to constantly switch between them which was originally drew me to the keyboard. But it seems like that too seemed to ware off. Now, the keyboard has a panic attack when I try to constantly switch between computers and I have to do a factory reset just to get it to work. AND HALF THE TIME IT DOESN'T WORK. I looked up and down the web to fix these problems but it seems like one out of every hundred or so units seem to have the issue according the frequency of reddit posts.

The only way it worked was to have it connected to usb, which defeats the purpose of this keyboard. After I got a replacement, the keyboard charges and I can use it wirelessly now. However both keyboards had the same problem: several of the keys have a sticky response to them. the left shift and spacebar on the second keyboard has a sticky feeling to it, which really throws me off since it feels like I didnt press it. Unfortunately, I can't seem to find another keyboard that offers the features this one does, so I think I'm stuck with this keyboard.

87,"Great keyboard, battery life could be better","I guess I was spoiled a bit by my Apple wireless keyboard, which lasted for what felt like months in between charges. This is more like a weekly thing. Not bad, but a bit inconvenient given that I use it in the living room and have to carry it to the charger (where it can't be used at the same time). The rest of the keyboard is great. Relatively inexpensive, easy to set up, compact, reliably connected, feels great to type on. The LEDs work just fine but it's not really my cuppa to leave them on. Edit: having looked at some of the other reviews, I do want to point out my own experience with bluetooth lag: I haven't noticed any substantial (or even noticeable) lag whatsoever. I haven't once had to wait for the keyboard to catch up, and I've been playing Doom Eternal without any issue. And I've had no problems maintaining a reliable connection. I also don't notice the keyboard go to sleep (though my other keychron keyboard, a k6 that I use for work, does go to sleep after a moment ... which is annoying).","Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2021",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,James Cunningham,4.0 out of 5 stars

89,"Great keyboard, with bad glitches","This keyboard is awesome in almost every way and I love it, while it works.  When using it on my PC via bluetooth, everything will work fine for a while, but then suddenly the keyboard will decide it wants to just hold down whatever keys I press for as long as it wants.  This resulted in me hitting 'backspace' and accidentally deleting multiple rows of text I did not intend to delete, all while desperately trying to hit buttons on the keyboard and click away to prevent the deletion.  So, basically the keyboard is worthless to anyone who is actually serious about typing, unless they can release a new version where this sitting-on-the-keys thing is fixed.

90,A Pretty Great Keyboard,"After using the Apple Keyboard and mouse, I had been dealing with some terrible wrist and hand pain. I wanted a solution to help better my typing posture and was recommended this keyboard. Once I got it, I was so surprised by all its features. I love the connectivity and overall typing experience. It is something I have to adjust to, but in a matter of days it's gotten easier and the pain I'd dealt with is pretty much nonexistent. Other features I like are the colorful RGB lighting, the fact I have three different angles to choose from in terms of the incline, and the fact I and switch from typing on my computer to typing on my iPad. That does lead to my one con though... When it came to figuring out how to switch devices, it was a bit confusing. Reading the pamphlet that came in the box, it was a little bit vague??? I mean I am more of a visual learner, so even when I looked for ""How To"" videos, it didn't help either. Most of them were review or cool ad videos that didn't display how to connect, disconnect and then switch to a different device. After an hour or two of messing around, I finally figured out (what I think is the right way) to switch from one device to the other. So if anyone reading the reviews is having an issue with that let me know and I can share what I do to switch. Other than that I like this keyboard from the sound/switches I chose (brown), RGB lighting, and overall typing experience. I would for sure recommend this to anyone who wants a MAC/WINDOWS friendly mechanical keyboard.","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2021",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YucIgpiaL._SY88.jpg'],Verified Purchase,Monserratt V.,5.0 out of 5 stars

94,"Beautiful piece of kit and a great, affordable intro to the universe of mechanical keyboards.","NOTE: Depending on which previous keyboard style you're coming from (Apple Magic Keyboard in my case), there will be a period of time where you will need to adjust and get comfortable to get back up to your original touch-typing speed without errors. This isn't specific to this particular product, just an aside that it is taking a bit for my muscle memory to adapt. I definitely recommend a wrist rest, as the keyboard does sit quite a bit higher than I'm used to. Your milage may vary, but it really helped in my case. I went with the aluminum frame/RGB version. Fit and finish on the aluminum bumpers is super clean. It really adds some heft and ups the quality of the feel. It's still relatively portable, but the extra weight keeps it put where you set it. I didn't think the RGB backlighting would matter much to me, because I'm using it in my design studio and the rainbow-chase effects don't appeal much to me. But what's really nice is that there is a static lighting setting and you can change the color of the RGB backlight to any of those RGB colors. The images I had seen online only showed static white, but the RGB version lets you pick. The Mac-centric media keys are a rarity in third-party offerings and are appreciated here. I ended up with the Gateron Brown switches and I think they're perfect for my personal preference, but you'll need to make your own way down that crazy rabbit hole to make your decision. Overall, really great look and functionality. It's also convenient to have the hotkeys to switch between my Macs/iOS devices on the fly. I was a little concerned at first because I couldn't find a caps lock status light, but it turns out that once it's engaged, the actual caps lock key's shine-through color becomes red.

It's pleasantly light and yet has a satisfying accoustics when the switches hit the bottom and then the top. It's not a silent switch, but it's not annoyingly loud like some blue switches. The factory lubrication is perfect and I couldn't have done it better myself. It could be used in some office settings where it's not too quiet. 3. It had one defect though. One key (i.e. the Y-key in the picture) had a little bump that was very noticeable when typing. I was going to change to custom keycaps anyway, but it's not some thing that you would expect in a over $100 keyboard. For the time being, I had to remove the bump with a sandfile but visually, it is damaged now. Overall, even with the defect, I am completely satisfied.

However, even after 6 months, I have not gotten used to the keybindings since it is a mini keyboard. I am constantly hitting print screen instead of delete. I also used the Bluetooth connection at first but switched to using the USB connection since it is much more reliable. I do enjoy that it is compatible with Mac and Windows.

The keys actually feel nice and aren't slippery like your default plastic keys (think Razer keyboards if you're familiar). The aluminum case feels hefty and solid. The reason I gave it one star is because the bluetooth is consistently disconnecting from my computer so I have to constantly reconnect it. The reconnection isn't easy either. Often times, I have to factory reset the keyboard or turn it off and back on then reconnect the bluetooth. It's a nightmare. The one thing I bought it for and it can't do it.

Unfortunately, it isn't as easy to find a good MK for a Mac as it is for a PC. I finally decided to pick up a Keychron K2, having heard good things about it and I'm NOT disappointed! I got the red switches and they are a little clacky when you bottom out the keypress, but it isn't too bad. The RGB is bright and there quite a lot of lighting options. This is my first compact keyboard so, for me, there is a little bit of a learning curve when it comes to hitting the arrow keys and the home/end/etc keys on the right side. I like that the keys are all a standard size as well, so I can replace the keycaps at some point in the future if I like. I had a Corsair K70 previously and it always frustrated me that I could never put cool keycaps on it because their bottom row sizes were so weird.","Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2020",Color: Gateron Red Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars
107,Great mech keyboard for the home office,"It is very tall so I recommend getting a wrist rest. Otherwise, I love this thing. It is easy to use and I love the clack it makes. My only conplaint is the placement of the screen capture button above the backspace. I got to delete something and accidently cause it to change to screen capture mode. This is especially annoying since I know the Mac shortcut for taking a screenshot and don't need a socialized button for that.","Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2020",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,K.

Only fault is the bluetooth takes 3-4 clicks to kick in from the sleep mode, but that’s just a minor issue now that I am aware of it and how to resolve. I don’t use all the various keyboard light color options, but they are quite spectacular for those into that sort of thing. I’d buy it again.

109,Excellent keyboard!,"I’ve been searching for a Bluetooth wireless mechanical keyboard for a while and found this one! I love that I can connect wired or wirelessly, the battery lasts weeks (without backlight), and it is a nice portable design over all. So many colors and led patterns! Cons: 1. Sometimes it acts weird when I switch between Bluetooth devices and becomes unresponsive. I turn it off and on and it is fine. 2. It’s only been about  6 months and the paint is falling off 3 of my keycaps!!!! Noooo!! Neutral: 1. Port is in an awkward spot, but I can live with it. 2. Reconnect can take about a second or two (Bluetooth) and it can be a bit annoying. 3. I wish it had macro functions 4. Backlight is dim, but I don’t really use it so it’s fine for me. If you expect this to be very bright, it’s not, and understandably so, if you want to conserve battery life. Overall, I love this keyboard and may eventually try the slim version of this keyboard.","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2021",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,"['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZNe-tpuKL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/916VLTH2IJL._SY88.jpg']",Verified Purchase,Albert cruz,5.0 out of 5 stars

111,A perfect wireless mechanical keyboard for $100,"$100 is a lot to spend on a keyboard. This is the best keyboard you can buy for the money though. It's compact yet spacious, it has an amazing feel to it, and the build quality is superb. I haven't used a mechanical keyboard in a long time, but this is one of the best I've used. The keys are clicky (I'm a big fan of hearing the click) and it types wonderfully. The backlighting feature is great, with multiple settings for color and brightness, and has different mode for different OS (Windows/And and Mac/iOS). I have the aluminim version, and it is built amazingly. It's hefty and durable. The only somewhat negative thing about this keyboard is its height. It's a bit tall, but once you get used to it, it's fine. You can also buy a small wrist rest if you so desire. For gaming, it's okay, not great. Since the keyboard is compact, it results in a few keys being smaller, including the cntrl/opt/cmd keys on the left. Besides those two things, this keyboard is phenomenal. I would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a good typing keyboard.","Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2020",,,Verified Purchase,Bill Tamburelli,5.0 out of 5 stars

Also, I haven't used it for gaming, so I can't say how reliable it is for gamers.

114,I should have gone with the blue keys!,"This is my first mechanical keyboard. I went with brown keys because I was worried about getting annoyed from the clicking (I have misophonia, which means that certain repetitive sounds can REALLY bother me, and I was worried that the keyboard clicks would become a trigger). I don't think the brown keys are tactile enough, though! I don't notice the bump at all when I'm typing normally, so I constantly end up bottoming out. I only notice if I press the key slowly and pay attention. There's also a bit of a hollow ""ping"" when I type (separate from the key clicks!) because the base is hollow, so something reverbs. Like the keys, though, I don't usually notice it unless I'm listening for it. Otherwise, I'm very happy with the keyboard! I use it in both Bluetooth and wired mode with my Mac, and it works very well.","Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2020",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,malue,4.0 out of 5 stars

148,Amazing Keyboard,"Best keyboards for MacOS users as well as Windows. The keyboard is very rigid with an aluminum base and is pretty heavy (if you want something lighter, get the regular plastic frame). I got the brown switches which are kind of like the in-between of the blue and red. The keyboard feels great to type on and has the perfect stilts to find your angle of typing. My favorite part has to be the RGB which has tons of different lighting effects, especially the on-press lighting effects which show when you press the key. Overall, great keyboard for anyone who wants to game or just type a bunch.","Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2021",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Russell D.,5.0 out of 5 stars

479,Mostly an improvement on the K1,"I backed this keyboard on kickstarter, and I bought the K1 while waiting to get this keyboard. The K1 had a serious issue with input sensitivity. You could barely tap a key and a keypress would register. Also, when using the keyboard with bluetooth it would frequently have issues where it would just randomly send long strings of characters. The K2 has none of this. I received the RGB metal Red switch model, and I love it. The key switches are an improvement over the K1. However, there are a few things that I don't like about the keyboard: 1. While the 84 key layout is fashionable I find it inferior to the K1's layout, especially the exclusion of a print screen key in favor of a screen capture key that has different mappings based upon which OS you have it set to. 2. On the K1 the switches and plug for the cable were on the back. On the K2 it is on the left side which is a bad idea. I am not left handed, but those who are and prefer using their mouse with their left hand shouldn't use this keyboard. 3. The K1's caps lock would light up when toggled on. The K2 gives no indication that the caps lock is on which is annoying. 4. I picked the RGB model because I wanted the aluminum chassis, but I wish there were an aluminum model with white LEDs. I'd prefer to have the LEDs off than have them be RGB. 5. I find myself hitting the LED mode key on the top right instead of the delete key far more often than I should which causes me to then have to press it a ridiculous amount of times to get back to my preferred LED setting. In a future model that key should be removed from the keyboard and instead be a toggle switch on the back of the keyboard. Once I set the LEDs like I like them there's no need to ever press that key again. 6. The end user should be able to customize the firmware of the keyboard with custom key settings. Remapping them in software isn't possible when for instance the screen grab key sends multiple keystrokes. I could also perhaps disable the LED light key as well. This would mostly solve two issues I have with the keyboard alone.","Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2019",,,,Dustin Wilson,4.0 out of 5 stars
480,Will Look Great in the Landfill,"So I used the K2 for three months during which time the bluetooth connection became less and less reliable. Then the slider switch for cable/bluetooth selection simple broke. It now slides freely with no effect whatsoever. Unfortunately, it broke with the keyboard on the bluetooth connection, which as mentioned, fails repeatedly. I'm giving two stars because the keyboard is nicely built. The housing is like a battleship. However, I may try to retrofit a custom keyboard into the k2 housing. It's that bad. UPDATE: totally dead now. No keyboard back lighting , can’t connect via Bluetooth or USB. The charging led is the only thing that works. Bluetooth/USB switch broke long ago. And reading many of the other 1 and 2 star reviews, k2’s die routinely. Taking a star away, total waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2021",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,,dadogg,1.0 out of 5 stars
481,Loses connection on Macbook Pro constantly.,"I fell in love with the look of this keyboard just scrolling through amazon. Noticed that they had an all metal version, and I ordered the Red button version, which is suppose to be the quietest version they sell. It's still on the loud side compared to the apple wireless keyboard. I really like typing on it. I feel that they made a solid product. I like the presets for the RGB backlighting. That all being said, there is one fatal flaw of this product: Connectivity. The keyboard constantly loses connection. I have to tap a key and wait a few seconds to type, while it regains connection. SMH, WHY???  My other bluetooth devices do not have this issue. I reset my bluetooth module as per Apple Support, and have forgotten the device several times to start a fresh bluetooth profile... nothing works. Keychron has horrible online support, and I understand that this was either an Indiegogo or Kickstarter project, but this keyboard is half baked. Work on the power management software, PLEASE! And yes, I have noticed a power management disable function on Keychron's support page. That doesn't work either.","Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2019",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,,Daniel Moran,2.0 out of 5 stars
482,"Fantastic produce.... except... left shift key seems to ""break"" easily","Ugh, wrote a long review and Amazon ""lost"" it. But I feel strongly about this so I'll try and write it again. This is a keyboard I want to love. It uses cherry switches which provide the feedback you want when programming or just touch typing.  You can choose which cherry switch (red, brown, black) from the most common ones out there (if you're not familiar with cherry switches or the differences, you should google it before selecting which keyboard you want).  Its only a slightly bigger footprint than the Apple wireless keyboard but is much taller (to accommodate the keys).  With the feet to tilt it and the long life battery, I would normally say this is a winner of a keyboard... and was about to write a review to that effect when... after two weeks... The left SHIFT key stopped working correctly.  Now since the shift key (like the return, space, or any larger than normal key) uses a mechanism to insure that the entire key goes up and down in a straight motion, I was suprised that with less than two weeks of use, that mechanism broke on the shift key.  What ends up happening of course is when you press the shift key, it doesn't come back up.  The second picture shows how it ""jams"" at an angle and requires either several taps or a paperclip to get back up.  Of course with programming or just about any typing, this effectively makes the keyboard a throw away.  I'm returning mine to ""hopefully"" get a replacement that last longer.  I'll add to this review if it has the same failure. I was very happy with the keyboard up until that point. At this point, its a paper weight in my laptop bag as I take it to the UPS store for return.  I do wish there was a better indication of battery life remaining as I've had it run out of power on me a few times without understanding that it was low.","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2020",Color: Gateron Red Switch v2,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kZS9RrNSL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zEYzzGe5L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FOm3RMNmL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71K5PcdWH-L._SY88.jpg']",,Marcos D.,3.0 out of 5 stars
483,The world of Mac capable keyboards is bleak.,"In a world of PC dominated mechanical keyboard options, the keychron k2 has stepped up. I am very impressed with the design and the options available for this keyboard. It is really sleek with the aluminum frame and I love the integration within Mac specific keys. I have multiple other mechanical keyboards that I use and when it comes to using them on any of my Mac interfaces, nothing compares to the keychron. With other boards I would have to either re write commands in gmk or just accept that I would have very limited capabilities when using them with Mac OS. But not with the K2. All my Mac specific commands worked right out of the box with the K2. And the multiple Bluetooth profiles are a blessing too. I can move my board from my iMac to my iPad to my iPhone all with two key strokes. The only thing I wish was an option was different colors with the board. A white version or an all black version would be great. The aluminum base is great and I know you can change keycaps ( which I have ) but having base color options would be a great addition. Also the location of the usb-c not ideal for me. I feel like it really looses aesthetic on my desk set up when I have it plugged in. The connection should definitely come out the back and not out of the side. But that’s all personal preference of course. But despite that it really is the only keyboard on the market that can fully integrate with Mac OS out of the box. I highly recommend this board.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2019",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,,Nathaniel T. Brooks,4.0 out of 5 stars
484,Too high and definitely not worth the price,"PROS: Light tactile feedback is great. The plastic keys are great at touch. CONS: At this price point I expected something better tested. I think the people that bought this either have a super high wrist rests, are gonna go for wrist surgery very soon or just on board the hype train. I have a wrist rest and I am still struggling to use it. Is it just TOO high. I understand you added large batteries but this is not an okay trade off. I tried positioning my hands further away, lowering the desk but still very uncomfortable. Second there is a metallic ring for some of the buttons and it's pretty noticeable...

485,Great Value on a Great Keyboard,"Have had my K2 for several months now. I replaced the keycaps it came with, and choose a clear gel to get as much out of the RGB lighting as possible. PROs: Price, at this price, for this feature set, you'd be hard pressed to find better or more features. Feel, solid, especially with the metal frame, but I also added o-rings to my keycaps when I replaced them. Mac compatible, not a thing for me, but I know for a lot of people this is a BIG deal. Works wirelessly or wired. Negatives. Feel. Solid enough, but I'd still add some O-rings just to make everything feel rock solid. They are still working on some firmware issues. I think for macs, you still need to update the firmware from a windows machine, though they MAY have fixed this issue. If its a problem for you, verify before you buy. Some nonstandard key placement due to the reduced footprint layout. This may be an issue for some touch typists. (I know for me, the bracket and quote keys sometime give me a problem, but I still LOVE it). Over all? You simply can't go wrong for the money for the value here. I bought mine with the brown gateron switches and this is, simply a great feeling keyboard.","Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2020",Color: Gateron Red Switch v2,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51EtMnobrXL._SY88.jpg'],,girlgamer,5.0 out of 5 stars

The multi-device feature is really what I was looking for on this keyboard. I also love typing on the Gateron Brown switches. They have a nice tactile feel. One dislike for me is the squeaky space bar which occurs when bottoming out hard. Putting a double o-ring on the keycap and lubing on the switch on it seems to help a lot. It is not perfect without some modding but this is a great keyboard overall for those who like the compact design.","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2020",Color: Gateron Red Switch v2,,,Tewit Srisomboon,5.0 out of 5 stars

488,"Wait for the Keychron K8, coming July 2020","I just wrote a long review and it got erased so I'm going to sum it up quickly. The Keychron is a great Mac-native-layout keyboard. You don't know how much you miss a Mac layout until you buy a Windows keyboard. If you use a Mac, you're going to want a Mac keyboard. Learn from my mistake. The height of the keyboard is definitely annoying. See my comparison photo with the Apple keyboard. I got a wrist rest to help solve the problem, but I bought a memory foam wrist rest and it's not good, so I'm returning it for a stiffer one. The main annoying thing is the layout of the keys. There are page up, page down, home and end keys on the right side that you easily accidentally hit and lose your place in a doc you're working on. Which brings me to the K8. Keychron is releasing the next keyboard, the K8, through Kickstarter, to ship July 2020. I ordered one and will return my K2 to Amazon. The K8 changes the key layout so you don't accidentally hit the wrong keys, and it looks like it will help quite a bit.","Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2020",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/418BaBzmOdL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZQnzeb-oL._SY88.jpg']",,Marcy K.,4.0 out of 5 stars

491,Fantastic value,"I had a simple set of needs, Bluetooth, TKL, and tactile/quiet switches, with Mac keycaps being a welcome extra. I have the Apple Magic Keyboard, but frankly, the typing experience is somewhat subpar. It's also the one with numeric input, so I was struggling with portability. This popped up in my search, and I decided to jump on the wagon. I'm not sure I would use it for gaming or anything that requires my hands to stay in place for a long period of time, the height is pretty insane compared to my dedicated gaming keyboard (Corsair K95), but I wanted something more portable, and this thing hits every mark I was looking for. The keyboard feels very well made. Very little deck flex. Switches between devices in a couple seconds seamlessly. I'm actually a little shocked at how well it switches between devices. I read some reviews about mistyping, and I was a little concerned, but now that I received it, I can solidly say the only mistakes are the ones I make, but with a caveat. The key spacing is a bit wider than most other keyboards I've used, and that has caused a slight uptick in my typing mistakes. It's only fractions of a millimeter larger between keys, but by the end of the keyboard, those slight additions add up to a couple millimeters. If you're jumping between keyboard regularly, that could get annoying, but I'm really only using my other keyboard for gaming, so my left hand doesn't notice the difference, and I anticipate once I'm a little more used to this keyboard, i'll no longer have any issues. Now the hunt begins for a wrist rest I'll actually like...","Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2020",,,,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars

513,Awesome mechanical keyboard for Apple devices,"I just read today that this keyboard made it to Engadgets Top 5 list for 2020. Having used this one myself for work on my Macbooks, I can attest that this keyboard is very worthy of that honor. There aren't a lot of Mac-specific mechanical keyboards out there, most are tailored for PCs with many Mac users opting for the keyboards made by Apple. Those are fine, but there are many that still prefer the robustness and durability that mechanical keyboards come with. This one is made with Macs in mind, including all the shortcut keys, which is a tremendous help. I love the design of the keyboard. Solid construction, beautiful keys, and the many backlight patterns are a nice touch. Typing on the keyboard feels great, very responsive. What also makes this keyboard stand out is the versatility. The keyboard can be used wirelessly via bluetooth or wired via USB with the flip of a switch. It's designed for Macs, but comes with replacement keys for PC users as well and will work with Windows/Linux computers as well with a flip of a switch. The bluetooth connectivity allows for up to 3 devices to be remembered. Meaning you can switch where your keyboard is connected to other devices easily using the fn+1, 2, or 3 keys that have the bluetooth icon on them. Meaning you can also connect this keyboard to mobile devices like an iPad (the keyboard is very handy for use with an iPad as well). All in all, this is a well designed, well built keyboard that's about as versatile as it gets and is ideal for Apple users who want a mechanical keyboard that meets their needs.

514,Very nice compact keyboard with bluetooth,"I was hesitant to take this keyboard as I have gone through a series of such mechanical keyboards over the year and got frustrated with their limitation vs price. I feel this K2 keyboard is at a sweet spot of price vs feature and is fun to use. I can summarize the keyboards in the following points - Pros - 1. I used it with both Mac and Windows machines and it worked seamlessly with them with the toggle switch 2. The keys are great to type and the design is ergonomic - so its fun to use when I have to type for 8-10 hours a day. 3. he keyboard has additional keys for windows if someone wants to customize the keys 4. I started liking the background color that changes in a cycle, particularly when I am typing in the dark 5. The built is solid and after more than a month of use I can see it will last for some time Cons - 1. The bluetooth connection gets lost after 5 min of idle usage and it was irritating in the beginning but now I have got a habit to wake the keyboard up and wait for a second to connect before starting to type. Later, I discovered that there is a shortcut command to keep the Bluetooth on but I feel that the default settings should be on. 2. The keyboard layout is a bit compact (compared to say Apple keyboard) so you need to try it for a few days first to get the keys correctly and it works well after that 3. I wish there was a mum pad section at the right (that is generally not there in the most mechanical keyboards) and it is very handy when you need to enter a lot of numbers (but that is me!)","Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2020",Color: Gateron Red Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,"Philosophically Your""S""",5.0 out of 5 stars
515,Love my Keychron,"This is my first mechanical keyboard, and I'm very pleased with it. Would quickly recommend to others. I've been happy with the feel and size (I wanted to keep arrow keys, but didn't need the numpad). I went with brown switches, since I wanted some feedback but not too much noise. I got the aluminum version as well, which I love (even though it isn't the entire housing). Big pros: I chose it in large part for Mac compatibility, and it's been a rockstar so far on that front. Paired immediately and I didn't have to change any keys. Function keys including play/pause worked out of the box. The Bluetooth is reliable and I haven't had any missed keystrokes, stuck keys, etc. Battery life has been good, too. The lighting options are great to have and play with. If you find one distracting, there are other choices. The LEDs are bright. The packaging is very high end looking and cool. A lot of folks don't like the side mounted cord, but I sort of prefer it, and the cord it comes with is nice. Some minor cons: I do note the same slight ""sproing"" sound as some other reviewers; it doesn't bother me much, but you should be aware if the sound is critical to you in keyboard choice. (I do think it could be fixed.) The ABS keycaps it comes with are good looking, but the feel of them isn't stellar. You may want to upgrade your most used keys, as you can see I did. It is thoughtful that they include a keycap puller as well as Windows alternate keys. You may have difficulty replacing ALL the keys due to size, but the vast majority are standard. Overall, a great keyboard and an especially good choice if you're a Mac user.

516,good wireless mechanical keyboard,"Pros: - Typing is great. - Easily switches between 3 different bluetooth connections. - Long lasting battery even with lights. - Auto 5 minute shut off **that can be disabled**. - Perfect size for me - I still need the function row for programming, and having them double as media keys is awesome. - 19 color modes Negatives: - It takes a couple of seconds between switching bluetooth connections - 5 minutes is a short time for auto shut off (but it can be disabled... but then your battery will die if you forget to turn it off) - Doesn't sync with other RGB stuff like some other things can","Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2020",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,craig in texas,5.0 out of 5 stars
517,clicky clacky fun,"This is my initial review of my k2 v2 brown switch rgb keyboard. So far I am enjoying myself lol.  I never thought I'd have so much fun just typing, but hitting these keys makes typing away really fun.  This is my first mechanical keyboard (other than growing up on some old school apple ones), so I'm sorta trying to feel out what this whole mechanical keyboard thing is about. I chose the brown switches because I heard they were a good balance between tactile actuation and typing speed.  I was looking for something that would be both comfortable to use in the office and during gaming time.  Pretty satisfied with the typing feel of these browns.  I soooortaa wish they were a little more clicky.  Like that there was a slight snap right before the type registering.  The cherry browns might have that feeling, but I heard the gateron browns are less like that and offer less fatigue during typing marathons.  If I could describe this typing experience with the gateron browns it would be: swift-clicky and fast-smooth. The sound to the clicky typing is really enjoyable and lends to the physical experience of typing.  Pressing the space bar is a triumph.  It's also got a good sound.  The gateron blues sounded too high pitch for my liking in videos I've seen. Other reviews mention that the key caps seem a bit thin and it's weird that I can sense that too, but it doesn't bother me too much.  I will probably upgrade the caps in the future. Not sure why, but my UP arrow was replaced with another ""control"" keycap.  Not sure if someone messed up in assembly or that they just ran out of up arrows.  It wasn't provided in the collection of extra caps that came with the keyboard.  I'm not SO bothered by it because I'll probably replace the caps sometime in the future, and I guess it's a nice little reminder that a human being was on the other end assembling this thing. Surprised how well the RGB lighting enhances the keys.  The character areas of the keys are see through and the lights shines through the empty spaces of the keys.  I like colors, but find them a bit annoying if they don't serve any purpose (I have rgb shut off on my rig)  but these don't bother me too much and you can adjust the brightness.  Got a subdued rainbow thing going on now. Pairing the keyboard with bluetooth was a little confusing at first.  The manual mentions to ""press 1+fn"" to pair  but it actually means ""HOLD 1+fn.""  Your computer should recognize your device and your 1 key should blink blue waiting for you to pair through your computer. The aluminum case feels strong and the weight of the thing feels substantial. Not sure about the battery life yet, but I'll remember to talk about that in an updated review. I ended up getting a glorious gaming wrist rest (tenkeyless size) for this thing.  It seems to suit the keyboard well.  It's a bit larger than the keyboard, but I wanted the freedom to rest my wrists at weird angles.  Other reviewers have complained about how high this keyboard is.  I have messed up wrists and really don't  want to find out how uncomfortable this thing would be without wrist rests.  Can imagine a compact wooden wrist rest working well with this thing, but none were in stock at my time of purchase. Just learned that there is a hotswappable version of the K2 :(  I think I would have gotten that one if I had known about it, but I think I'm still pretty satisfied with this version.  There have been reviews complaining about the reliability of the hotswappable keychrons and the hotswappable K2 doesn't have enough reviews to qualify me confidently purchasing it. So far pretty satisfied with my purchase.  Not totally blown away ( I think I would need to build my own mechanical keyboard to get it perfect), but it's a nice and solid introduction to the material enjoyment of mechanical keyboards. Review update, one week of use: Getting pretty fond of this keyboard.  I don't know if it's me reading more about mechanical keyboards on reddit or if I'm really starting to be that picky, but these stock keycaps are annoying the pants off of me.  They have a high pitch tap, sound a bit hollow, and feel thin.  It's strange that those are things that you can register in your brain, but maybe having much better quality switches unlocked new senses in my noggin. I ended up ordering a set of new keycaps.  They are double shot pbt's with a cherry profile and I got them here on amazon.  Non-backlit because I kept reading bad sensory feedback on anything that was backlit or translucent (i.e.  shine throughs or translucent puddings).  Be sure to look for keycap sets for 84 keys or a 75% layout with a cherry mx compatibility.  Also, refer to the keycap layout and size map on keychron's website for a sizing comparison.  found it hard to find keycap sets for this 75% layout.  You either have to buy a set meant for a larger keycap layout or really find a special set.  You can find a 75% set on KBD fans, find a few here on amazon, be lucky to find a set on mass drop, or order a custom one for 75% keyboards on wasdkeyboards.com (*note that they can only make it out of ABS plastic).  Another option is to buy a set meant for a smaller layout and live with having the stock keycaps on for your rightside alt, fn, control, and shift keys. It would be icing on my sensory cake to have special switches for things ( like a clicky blue for the ""esc"" key, ""enter"", or ""space bar"" but so far really liking these browns.  I've read that the zealio purple switches have a similar feel, but more of a bump.  Probably be into a keyboard of those in the future.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2021",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars
518,Amazing Keyboard For Mac!,If your looking for a mechanical keyboard for mac look no further than this. If your sick of the flat apple keyboard like me this is a huge upgrade. The keys are lovely I personally got the blue since i love the clicks and the clacks and it feels amazing! They keyboard feels nice when typing for long periods of time an and my wrists don't hurt after long periods of work. Having the media keys and command keys is amazing! The battery usually lasts me the entire week on a full charge and the next day if its dead ill usually just plug it in and use it in cable mode which is fantastic. Works the same as in Bluetooth with zero latency in Bluetooth mode or cable mode. Note if you turn on the auto shut off feature it will probably  last longer but I have this off because it annoys me. If you are looking for a mechanical keyboard this is the best choice by FARRRR. I have no complaints about the keyboard so far and I love using it everyday I much prefer it then my old apple keyboard that was flat. If you have never used a mechanical it will change your life and from that point on you wont be able to use a regular membrane keyboard. I have used it for very light gaming like Minecraft and once again no complaints. I cannot recommend this enough... Definitily  worth the price and its cheaper than a lot of other mechanical keyboards. Would recommend if you are on Windows or Mac. Works flawlessly with both! 100% worth the price.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2020",Color: Gateron Blue Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Omar Ajouz,5.0 out of 5 stars
519,"Great compact keyboard for MacOS, but you'll probably want a wrist rest to go with it","I was previously using the Apple Magic keyboard, and was tired of typo-ing all the time, and wanted to move back to a mechanical keyboard.  After doing a bit of research, I went with the K2, and it's been great.  It has a nice solid build, nice tactile keys but not *too* Clicky-clacky (I got the brown switches).  Typing on it has taken a little bit of getting used to (the Command Key is a bit smaller, the Home key is on the right side of Enter, etc.), but I've been using it now for about a week and I'm really liking it.  Part of the reason I got this one is that the Esc key is right above the top row (I'm a vi guy so I need my Esc key :))  It's definitely a bit taller than the Magic Keyboard, so I got one of the wooden wrist rests for it (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08XYN7L61/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), which is pretty much a necessity for me.

521,One of the best wireless mechanical keyboard on the market!,"Found out about this keyboard from Instagram, and backed the original kickstarter on a whim. I was in the market for a wireless keyboard, and most of the reputable ones were either low-quality ones for using with a TV or obnoxious gaming models like the G613. The Anne Pro 2 and Drevo Calibur were often recommended, but their form-factors and key selection were too small for my needs. The Keychron K2 is in a sweet spot for me because it's mechanical, has a simple aesthetic suitable for both office/gaming, and has enough keys for me to be productive while still keeping the footprint small: PROS: - Mechanical + wireless, a pretty rare breed in the market right now - Bluetooth connection, no dongles - USB-C port, you don't have to keep a micro-sd around just for this device - Mac + Windows modes + extra keycaps. Most mechs do not support Macs at all. - Battery life is good if you use the default power-saving mode (sleeps after 10 mins) CONS: - Bluetooth connection from sleep can be a bit spotty. Sometimes it will connect in 2 seconds, sometimes it'll take 8-10. - Slight glitch where the keyboard will type in CAPS for the first 1-2 letters as it wakes up - Chassis is thicker than most keyboards throughout the body, so this keyboard can start to hurt if you're not using a palmrest. - Gateron switches aren't that great. It definitely keeps the cost low, but I find that these gaterons are less smooth, specifically comparing the Gateron browns in my unit to the Cherry MX Browns in my CoolerMaster QuickFire Rapid. - Non-standard TKL layout. Since the layout isn't really found in any other keyboards, your muscle memory won't transfer as well, especially if you use multiple keyboards. Overall, a great keyboard for people who want to declutter their desk but still enjoy the feeling of a mechanical. Keys feel fine (not amazing), and the wireless mode is fine for casual gaming. Wired mode is just as reliable as a normal wired keyboard, with better response time.","Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2020",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Eric Xie,4.0 out of 5 stars

557,Best Bluetooth mechanical keyboard out there in my opinion,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. First off, I would like to mention that mine is the 1st version k2. But the changes between the first and second version isn’t much. And, a warning: THIS IS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN YOU BUY, I MODDED MINE. First, please don’t buy blue switches. They are so extremely loud and make it unusable. But I guess everyone has there own opinion. I am sure that anyone, especially teenagers, would immediately chose the blue switches as they sound the most satisfying. But I think everyone grows out of this stage. For me, I left my keychron k2 in my drawer because of how much I disliked the blue switches and inability to use them in the night. However, this would be a rating of gateron blues and this is. As for this keyboard, it is absolutely wonderful. I did run into a few Bluetooth issues in the beginning and I honestly did have a lack of customer support to which I would wait nearly a month, if not, more to get a response. However, I think these Bluetooth issues were user error, because now I don’t run into any, and all thanks and praise is for Allah. When I wanted to mod my k2 I emailed customer support many times to ask for specifications and etc, and I would get immediate responses. Usually less than a day. What I did to my keychron k2: Neoprene foam (1/8”) between plate and pcb 3 layers of 1/8” neoprene foam in the case. O-ring mounted and only used 4 standoffs to screw in to the case Bandaid modded stabs by putting bandaids on both the plate and pcb, and I also hole bandaid modded the stabs (but I don’t recommend hole bandaid mod since it results in mushy sounding). Replaced stock stabs with everglide clipin stabs lubed with krytox 205g0 Lubed and filmed novelkey creams. SA PBT Keycaps Spray painted case gloss white. Used self etching primer, gloss white enamel, and gloss clear enamel (please don’t spray paint, use a brush instead). I ran through 6 cans of spray paint so far, messed up multiple times, and still left with a horrible finish. Now it sounds amazing, and all praise is due to Allah. The thing I enjoyed was that I didn’t have to buy a separate case, pcb, and plate to build a similar keyboard. I just used a prebuilt keyboard and customized it to sound the way I liked. And a huge plus is that it is Bluetooth and compatible with multiple devices. Through the process of desoldering the keyboard, i ripped multiple pads and multiple traces, however, still, in the end I just had to use a few wires to fix the pcb. So I think the pcb is very well made. The only reason I ripped the traces and pads was because I was getting frustrated desoldering as I would reapply solder and desolder each pin multiple times and it still wasn’t a clean desolder. So I would try to pull it out with force and in that process I broke nearly 15 things. Around 11 pads and 3 or 4 traces. So please be careful and don’t be impatient like me when desoldering. I would have really preferred it to be stock hot swappable, but I know that they do sell a hot swappable version. A very good keryboard that is very customizable. Just be careful with the pcb as i contacted keychron and they told me that they don’t sell the pcb separately. As for the keyboard, rgb looks stunning, battery life is so long that I never worry about charging it. I don’t think it has ever been below 70%. And I rarely ever have it plugged in. I also don’t usually have it on rgb mode though since rgb isn’t my thing.","Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2021",Color: Gateron Blue Switch v2,['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1qFs1AyIOS._SY88.jpg'],,Azoic Keycaps,5.0 out of 5 stars

559,,"Hasta la fecha no me ha dado ningún problema en Mac, aunque en Windows en Chrome tiene un comportamiento un poco extraño, cuando escribo rápidamente en el transcurso alguna letra se queda como si la hubiera dejado presionada, algo así: holllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllla Pero curiosamente solo me pasa en Chrome en Windows, no probé otros navegadores. En Mac todo funciona correctamente.","Reviewed in Mexico on September 7, 2021",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Iván Hdz D,
560,,"Si buscas un teclado mecánico te recomiendo keychron y si pasas mucho tiempo trabajando mejor utiliza un palm rest para no lastimar las muñecas. A mi me gusta usarlo cableado para evitar las interferencias de WiFi y otros periféricos. En relación al precio lo puedes conseguir más barato en la página oficial pero debes tener en cuenta los impuestos de importación y el tiempo de entrega, por eso mejor lo adquirí por Amazon.","Reviewed in Mexico on May 30, 2021",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Hugo,
561,,"The battery life does not live up to what it advertises, however the keyboard is great quality and probably one of the best budget keyboards you can get online. Cant complain. I swapped out the stock keycaps with the HK gaming keycap set (also from amazon). Ordered with amazon prime, and got it the next day. I use this as my everyday and gaming keyboard","Reviewed in Australia on August 22, 2021",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Gna,
562,,"El precio al que lo conseguí, lo siento un poco elevado. Sin embargo decidí esa opción porque era la más segura. La sensación del teclado es increíble, se siente resitente y de buena calidad. El único pero que tengo es que la configuración de las teclas viene americano. Me tendré que acostumbar a usarlo.","Reviewed in Mexico on June 6, 2021",Color: Gateron Brown Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Rodrigo Sánchez,
563,,"Es muy comodo para trabajar, el click de las teclas es agradable no muy ruidoso, para jugar tambien es muy comodo ya que es muy compacto y no estorba el uso del mouse, el único inconveniente por asi decirlo es la distribución de teclado pero en lo particular y como desarrollador no dificulta nada el trabajo.","Reviewed in Mexico on January 6, 2021",Color: Gateron Red Switch v2,,Verified Purchase,Glenn,
564,,The keyboard was nice while it was working but no paths or information to recover. The bluetooth connection process doesn't fire so no real solution for me. There's little/no support online and no contact paths through Amazon. Support just auto replies with order tracking information.,"Reviewed in Australia on November 8, 2021",,,Verified Purchase,Steve Nash,
